      FOREWORD

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS is a tale of
      youth&mdash;of its loves and dreams and hazards, and of the incredible
      riches of purity which often belong to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the adventures which led to the Hand-Made Gentleman and the shop
      at Rushwater are from the author's own experience. Pearl is a composite of
      Davenport (the country blacksmith who invented an electric motor in 1833)
      and of a certain modest veteran of northern New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      It tells how steam-power chose its first long pathway and began its swift
      errands from the Atlantic to the middle continent; how the roar and rush
      of the water-floods betrayed their secret and suggested the coming of
      great things; how &ldquo;the horses of the river&rdquo; began to tread the turbine and
      yield their power to man; how the spirit of new enterprise contended with
      conservatism, ignorance, and greed in the capitals, and how, thereby,
      evils developed which we are now striving to correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      For its background of railroad and political history the author is
      indebted to many forgotten records, and to his friends A. Barton Hepburn,
      William C. Hudson, Arthur D. Chandler, and Mark D. Wilber, an honored
      Assemblyman in the sessions of 1865, 1866, and 1867, and later United
      States District Attorney. For the color of the day in Pittsburg, at the
      close of the war, he is under obligation to Mr. Andrew Carnegie; for that
      of Black Friday, to Mr. Thomas A. Edison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The author has held to no strict observance of the unity of place, the
      work of his characters being that of turning the State into one
      neighborhood.

    <p>
      WAS born in 1843. Since then I have endured many perils, of which I shall
      try to tell you. First of all, there was the peril of being named Solomon;
      and it would appear that, fora day or two, I was threatened also with the
      name of Zephaniah, but escaped at last with the lighter penalty of Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I found myself I had just printed my full name in big letters on a
      slate&mdash;Jacob Ezra Heron. I have had some success, but&mdash;bless
      you!&mdash;it is poverty when I think of the sense of riches that I had
      that day. I will try to give only the merest outline of my chief assets,
      and they were: this name, which was all my own; a mother, who was the
      joint possession of myself and my sister, four years older than I; one
      friend of the name of Lizzie McCormick, and one little green book which
      was a legacy from my grandmother. I had practically no liabilities save a
      number of unpunished sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, a little as to my schedule of assets. First of all, there is the boy
      indicated by the name on my slate&mdash;a small boy five years old. I was
      in the little red school-house! My eyes were not much above the level of
      my reading-book that rested on the teacher's knee. The watch at her belt
      seemed to prattle in my ear as if to put me out, and, when she opened the
      hateful thing, I felt sure it complained of me, for immediately she grew
      impatient. I was afraid, and spoke scarcely any louder than the watch
      itself. I feared that somebody would do something to me, and I had three
      occupations&mdash;looking out for danger, drawing cats, and printing my
      name on a slate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every evening I used to sit by the fireside in my little chair and rock
      and sing. My mother called me Cricket, because I was small and spry and
      cheerful. Others called me Cricket because she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, an important item in the schedule is my friend and confidant, Lizzie
      McCormick. She was one of the most remarkable things that ever was, being
      much and yet nothing. She was a myth&mdash;a creation of my fancy&mdash;but
      almost as real as any of you sitting here. There was a drunken old
      bachelor of the name of McCormick who lived not far away, and Lizzie
      claimed that she was his girl. I made her acquaintance one day when I had
      been very bad and was shut in my room alone. She sprang out of the air
      suddenly, and sat down beside me on the rag carpet, and made a gulping
      sound&mdash;like that of &ldquo;a hen with the pip,&rdquo; as our washerwoman said
      when I tried to make the sound for her. Lizzie was a freckled girl with
      red hair and a very long neck, and gold teeth and a wooden leg, because
      she had been shot in the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      We played marbles together, and talked freely in a tongue so &ldquo;foreign&rdquo;
       that no human being could understand it, as my mother informed me later.
      She showed me her trinkets, and among them was a thing she called &ldquo;a
      silver horruck,&rdquo; which Santa Claus had brought to her&mdash;a shiny thing
      that looked like a goose's leg. She was with me a good deal after that,
      and always slept with me in my trundle-bed. In due time she began to do
      and say things for which I was held responsible, and eventually became a
      ghost, when I would have no more to do with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will remember I spoke of the little green book. It was kept in a high
      drawer. Often I begged for a look at it, and when my mother opened the
      drawer I was on my tiptoes and reaching for the sacred thing. When I had
      looked at the pictures she put it away again very tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that is about as things stood with me in my childhood. I have given
      you a core out of the bed-rock, and let it go at that&mdash;saving one
      circumstance. It will all help you to understand me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I come now to the true tales, which are better for the fireside, on a
      white Christmas, than all that kind of thing. First, I shall tell you the
      very brief adventure of
    </p>
    <h3>
      CRICKET AND THE CHILD GHOST
    </h3>
    <p>
      Go back with me to the winter of 1850, when hard times travelled over the
      land like a pestilence, and even entered the houses of the great. I was in
      my seventh year, and my assets had been largely increased by the steady
      friendship of Santa Claus. But he was going to pass me that year, the
      times being harder for him than for other people. I felt sorry for him,
      and sorry for my sister and mother, and sorry, too, for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it was the day before Christmas, and I had been to school and was on
      my way home alone, my sister being ill, and night was near. Suddenly I
      became aware that Lizzie McCormick was limping along beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't pay to be good,&rdquo; said she, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been very good for a long, long time,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I've filled the
      wood-box every night an' morning, an' I gave half my candy to Sarah. I
      guess God was surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So was Sarah,&rdquo; she answered, as I recalled the delight of my sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought a moment and then said, &ldquo;God loves me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't he give you a pair of new boots, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's hard times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gives 'em to some children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt of the treasure, which I had concealed in my pocket, and wondered
      whether, under the circumstances, I had better let it go. I tried to take
      a look at it, but the air was dusky and I could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; Lizzie called, swinging her wooden leg very fast and keeping
      ahead of me. &ldquo;I ain't going home. I'm going to see if I can find Santa
      Claus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So 'm I,&rdquo; was my answer. &ldquo;Maybe he'll give us a ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We hurried along without speaking until I saw how dark it was, and knew
      that we were a long way from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother will be looking for me!&rdquo; I called, with a little sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie stopped and again made a sound like that of a hen with the pip, and
      I knew it to be a token of her contempt for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe there is any Santa Claus,&rdquo; she remarked, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been thinking of that. The faith of my childhood was failing a
      little, but I clung to the dear old saint and could not let him go.
      However, I was on the brink of change.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Lizzie put her hand in my coat-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;see what you've got now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt, and upon my word there was something hard in my pocket wrapped in
      tissue-paper, and it felt very promising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a real horruck,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I am going to give it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I saw her hand moving before my face. I put up my own hand, but hers
      began to fly around in the air, and I could not touch it. Now I suddenly
      remembered that ghosts had a trick of that kind, for so the washerwoman
      had informed me. For the first time I began to think of the word, and felt
      its mystery. Lizzie stood shivering, and a sound came out of her mouth
      like wind whistling in a chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go 'way!&rdquo; I cried, in a fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie turned and looked at me and uttered a cry of fear, and began to
      run. Her clothes had a strange rustle, and I could scarcely see her in the
      darkness. She seemed to run up a stairway into the snowy air, and was out
      of sight in a jiffy. Then I could hear her screaming to me in a dark
      tree-top, as if she saw something terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, Cricket! Look out! Look out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was in a panic of fear, knowing not the peril that threatened me. I
      struggled through the drifts and ran till I 'could see the lights of the
      village. The sight allayed my fear a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had heard that hymn-singing was good in time of peril, and I began to
      walk and sing, with a trembling voice, the Christmas hymn which my mother
      had lately taught me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon I knelt for a moment in the snow and said my prayers. Then I rose and
      ran on, singing as I went, and thought less of my peril. Soon teams began
      to pass me, coming and going, and my fear was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt for my horruck. It was in my pocket, all right, and the feel of it
      began to fill me with wonder. I forgot it when I came to one of the
      stores, and entered behind the legs of a tall man, and stopped before a
      basket of oranges, and stood looking down at them. There were a number of
      people in the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like one?&rdquo; a man asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I haven't any money,&rdquo; was my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put one in your pocket,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;they wouldn't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head, and answered in a voice so low that he held his ear down
      to catch the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't belong to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted me in his arms and asked my name, and I gave it, and told him
      that I was out looking for Santa Claus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he coming to your house?&rdquo; the man asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cause it's hard times,&rdquo; I whispered,
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it was the storekeeper himself, and he kissed me and sat me on the
      counter and gave me fruits and candies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to speak to Santa Claus?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded, and my heart began to beat all the faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the rear end of the store and returned quickly with a stout,
      gray-headed man in a big fur overcoat. I recognized the figure, and was
      almost overcome with emotion. The thought of my mission bore me up. With a
      trembling hand I took from my pocket the little green book which my
      grandmother had given to me, and which was, indeed, my greatest treasure.
      I had removed it slyly from the bureau drawer that morning. I held it
      toward him. No human being ever offered more to charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a Christmas present for you,&rdquo; I said, fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took my little book, and read the title on its green paper cover aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spoke up faintly as soon as he had finished, saying, &ldquo;My grandmother
      gave it to me&mdash;you can have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said he, and laughed, which so took me down that I could not
      keep back my tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a good boy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's one of the best boys in the county, and I'm going to keep track of
      him,&rdquo; said the storekeeper, and I was glad, for I was not able to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he to Santa Claus, &ldquo;I want you to take him home and give them
      all a merry Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, they put a little fur coat upon me and a piece of goat-skin for a
      beard, and a baby pack-basket, and filled it with grand things for my
      mother and sister, and put a stub of a pipe in my mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man took me home, and I was forgiven, I fancy, on account of my looks,
      for who could punish a fairy Santa Claus? And, all in all, what a merry
      Christmas we had! I had exchanged the little green book for something
      better, of which I shall try to tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Lizzie McCormick, she remained a ghost, and probably found better
      company, for I never saw her again, although sometimes I have heard her
      whisper in the darkness. She taught me that ghosts are easily conquered if
      a boy will be stern with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there remains with me a strange souvenir of our parting, and that is
      the horruck. It was a real thing; I have it now, a big silver dollar. Here
      it is. Look at the odd device stamped on the face of the coin:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>

      <a href="images/0033.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      I assure you, for many a long year it was the great mystery of our house.
      And I got a certain fear of it by-and-by, knowing, as I did, that a ghost
      gave it to me.

    <p>
      Y home had been a grist-mill in old times, and stood on the river-shore
      near a small village. One side of it was in the stream, but firmly founded
      on a ledge, and the year round water roared through a part of the
      basement. A hanging stairway climbed the face of the mill to a narrow
      landing under its eaves. There a broad door with a clanking iron latch
      opened upon our home. Those days it was called the Mill House, and a
      pretty thing it was&mdash;weathered gray, with broad windows that had
      small panes in them, and vines and flowers on the ledges in summer-time,
      and honeysuckle on the stair side.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I look back at the old house the sun is ever shining on it and the
      flowers are in full bloom, and I can see the lights and shadows of the
      river. It was a full flowing stream, smooth and silent above the mill, and
      stained and sprinkled with willow gloom; white and noisy-just below, where
      the waters hurtled over a natural dam of rocks. It put me in mind of the
      sea, toward which it was ever flowing, and which I had studied with a
      curious eye in my geography. The river always seemed to invite me to go
      along with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, one day, when near the end of my fifteenth year, I accepted its
      invitation&mdash;launched my new canoe and went away with the swift water.
      It was a clear, warm day, and the river gave me rare entertainment, with
      its reeds and wild roses and quiet little bays and green, sloping
      terraces, and birds and beasts. Where it bent to the edge of the highway I
      saw a man sitting on the bank&mdash;a lank, tall man, with white hair and
      a full, gray beard. A black setter dog with tan points sat beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy new year!&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer, but swung into the bay near him and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you know that a new year begins every day?&rdquo; he asked. He showed
      the wear of hard times. He had a shoe on one foot and a slipper on the
      other, and wore a soiled linen duster and a pair of goggles. I saw now
      that his face had been badly scarred. He had a nose large at the end, with
      white and red seams in it, which cut across the cheek to his temple on one
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you something almighty singular,&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; was my query.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took off a shabby felt hat, spat into the river, and drew his hand
      across his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Pearl,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I am the Pearl o' great price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled, but he looked very serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am weary o' life,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I came down to this river to drown
      myself, but I am unable to do it on account o' my meanness. It's a pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited, full of curiosity, while he sat and whittled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life is insured&mdash;that's what's the matter,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;You see,
      I took out a policy years ago an' paid for it, an' an' ol' buzzard got it
      for a few dollars that I owed him. If I die the meanest man in the world
      'll git a thousand dollars, an' it won't do; come to think it over, I 've
      got to outlive him if it takes a hundred years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw his slippered foot over his knee, laughed silently, and shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's one on me,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It ain't decent for me to laugh, but I
      can't help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sick?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exac'ly sick,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;When I behave myself I wouldn't know
      that I had a body if it wasn't for my big toe that keeps peekin' through
      my shoe leather. Sometimes it makes a bow, very p'lite, an' says, 'Hello,
      there!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and took off his hat. &ldquo;Look at me&mdash;ain't I a gem?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry for you,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good! I'm tired o' bein' sorry for myself, an' glad to have some
      one 'tend to that part o' my business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called the dog to his feet, put a hand on his head, and introduced him
      in this manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my friend and fellow-citizen, Mr. Barker&mdash;Adam Barker bein'
      his full name. You see before you the firm of Pearl &amp; Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled, and thought him an odd man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Barker, please take the floor,&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog stood on his hind feet with a look of eager expectancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Barker, I swear to you that hereafter I will be worthy of your love,&rdquo;
       said the stranger. &ldquo;Shall the firm continue? Those in favor will please
      say aye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog gave a bark, and his master said: &ldquo;It seems to be carried; it is
      carried. Is there any further business to come before this meetin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barker answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we stand adjourned,&rdquo; said the man, whereupon the dog began to jump
      playfully. &ldquo;Pearl &amp; Company are now ready to resume business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Man and dog sat looking at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can do anything,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Bring us a pig's tail an' we'll make a
      whistle of it; bring us a ton of iron an' we'll build a steam-engine. I
      put in the skill an' labor, an' Mr. Barker furnishes the company. Got to
      have that in every kind o' business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer, but sat looking at this wonderful man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where ye goin'?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So'm I,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Give me the stern seat an' I'll furnish the power. If
      you're goin' to be sorry for me, you'll have enough to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I swung her stem to the shore and let them in. He took the paddle, and the
      dog a place between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handsome little river&mdash;this here,&rdquo; said my new friend, as he cut the
      ripples with a powerful stroke. &ldquo;Think o' the strength of her,&rdquo; he went on
      presently; &ldquo;she keeps a-pushin' night an' day. The power of a thousand
      horses couldn't hold her for a second. If she only had brains she could do
      half the work o' the county.&rdquo; After a moment's silence, he added: &ldquo;If
      somebody would go into partnership with her and put up brains against her
      strength, the firm would do wonders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That view of the river was new to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see Niagara Falls?&rdquo; the stranger asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must go and see that big water-hammer hit the side o' the world. It
      weighs a million tons or more, an' swings a hundred an' fifty feet, an'
      for a dozen miles you can hear the boom of it. Think o' the power in that
      blow. One o' these days it's goin' to help push us along an' kick a lot o'
      things out of our way. Down below, the rapids run like wild horses. I call
      'em God's horses. One o' these days they'll put 'em on the tread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the tread!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; every one of 'em 'll tread a turbine an' move a belt, an' then&mdash;&rdquo;
       He paused and spat over the gunwale, and I looked at him full of wonder.
      &ldquo;'Lectricity!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;streams and rivers o' lightnin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words impressed me deeply, but I did not fully comprehend them until
      more familiar with his habit of putting his thought into terms of power.
      But I thought often of the &ldquo;big water-hammer&rdquo; and of &ldquo;God's horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at the fish,&rdquo; he said, after a moment of impressive silence. &ldquo;One of
      'em just looked up an' winked at me real insultin'. I don' know but we'd
      better get offended an' go after em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No tackle,&rdquo; was my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll make some,&rdquo; said he, promptly. &ldquo;We're goin' to be hungry
      by-an'-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went ashore, stripped some bark off a willow, split it into strands,
      and began to braid them. In a few moments he had made a fairly good line,
      and tied it to the end of a pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have a snare or a hook?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I can make ary one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A snare,&rdquo; I answered, for I had never seen a snare.
    </p>
    <p>
      He removed a piece of wire from the anchoring, made a loop, and fastened
      the line upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now slip that over their noses an' jerk,&rdquo; he said, as he passed the pole
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked the paddle and I the pole, and soon we had half a dozen fish,
      and quite enough for a meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's time that we organized for dinner,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'll be the cook if
      you'll be the commissary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be surprised if you find salt an' pepper in yon farm-house,&rdquo; he
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the house indicated, which was not a stone's-throw from the
      river-bank, and there a woman gave me all I sought, and, when she had
      learned my name, added butter and half a loaf of bread and a bit of
      shortcake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are promoted for meritorious conduct,&rdquo; said the Pearl, on my return.
      &ldquo;You are appointed corporal of the guard, and will have nothing to do now
      but keep the cows out o' camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had built his fire in a grove that flung its shade over a bit of still
      water. There a number of cattle had gathered, and were gazing at us. Soon
      a bull came roaring into camp, and stood and pawed the earth and
      threatened me. I cut him with a beech-rod, and drove him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are promoted for bravery,&rdquo; said the Pearl of great price; &ldquo;I appoint
      you my friend for life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me his hand, and I looked up at him with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you accept the appointment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I answered, for I was delighted with my new acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I promise, boy, that H. M. Pearl, Esquire, will
      never bring the blush of shame to your cheek, and I am yours truly, now
      an' forever&mdash;one an' inseparable.&rdquo; In a moment he added: &ldquo;I ain't
      pretty, but I can be decent, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I enjoyed him more than the dinner, and we made a wonderful day of it.
      After an hour's rest we set out again, and near three o'clock landed at
      the little village of Mill Pond, some ten miles away. From the shore I
      could see on a store-front the sign
    </p>
    <h3>
      SAM WEATHERBY'S EMPORIUM
    </h3>
    <p>
      A man stood on the steps of the emporium looking at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Pearl, is that you?&rdquo; he exclaimed as we drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's me, but it ain't Pearl,&rdquo; my friend answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turned over a new leaf. The late H. M. Pearl is now H. M. Pearl, Esquire.
      This is my friend. His name is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heron,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Cricket Heron?&rdquo; the stranger asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you remember coming to my store at Heartsdale one Christmas eve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you said you would keep track of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I moved down the river long ago, and I've been thinking for a month
      that I would go and have a talk with you and your mother. I want a clerk,
      and if you wish to learn a good business I'll take you in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, he showed me through the store, and I was much elated, and told
      about the child ghost and all the details of my straying that Christmas
      eve, and showed them my horruck, and Mr. Pearl sat down to study it. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to go,&rdquo; I said, as he reluctantly surrendered the coin;
      &ldquo;good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It's a hard pull against the current, an' I'm
      goin' to take you home. You wouldn't get there till to-morrow mornin.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, he <i>would</i> go with me, and so we set out together&mdash;the
      Pearl having left his dog with Mr. Weatherby. As we made our way upstream
      he told me tales full of the oddest fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by it grew dark, and I could hear only the dip of his paddle and
      water washing on the bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he exclaimed, suddenly, &ldquo;that's an awful curious riddle that you've
      got in your pocket there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed not to hear me, but continued to work his paddle in silence
      until we got out below the Mill House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of the ghost riddles?&rdquo; he asked, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wouldn't wonder if it was one of em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the ghost riddles?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you some time; my sister had one give to her,&rdquo; he said, as he
      started down the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to stay all night with us!&rdquo; I called. But I could hear only
      the sound of his feet on the gravel as they hurried away.

    <p>
      HAT week my clerkship began with Mr. Weatherby. To my great disappointment
      &ldquo;the Pearl of great price&rdquo; had left the village of Mill Pond, having gone
      nobody knew where.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my duty to sweep the floor and clean the windows, pump the
      kerosene, draw the West India molasses, and, when not otherwise employed,
      to sell tea, candy, and tobacco. The kerosene department took most of my
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I was in love with a girl much older than I, but the odor of
      petroleum, which, in spite of soap and water, maintained its hold upon me
      day and night, gave me the feeling of a tethered dog. Hope would not live
      with it, somehow. Then my face itself was so innocent of beard, beauty, or
      manliness. The little mirror which hung in a corner of the store flung
      back at me, always, a look of sheer contempt. One day, when I was alone, I
      took a store razor and began my first shave. As I went on, my face seemed
      to be enlarging and taking a highly serious view of itself. I stood by the
      mirror feeling it. As I did so, secret and burning thoughts began to move
      my tongue. Unconsciously I was talking to myself when I heard a loud
      guffaw. It was Bony Squares, lately returned from a far city to his home
      at Mill Pond. He was a printer who had travelled much, and could box and
      play ball and keep a crowd roaring on the store-steps every Saturday
      night. Moreover, he wore boiled shirts, and collars cut very low, and
      wonderful neckties of colored silk, and had a smart way with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you've been a-shav-ing yerself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled and blushed, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his walking-stick and hopped over it two or three times, and
      cackled, &ldquo;Ha, ha! ho, ho! You're going to have a mustache, and then you're
      going to see a gal by the name o' Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if ruin stared me in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lend me two dollars,&rdquo; Bony Squares demanded. &ldquo;Come, be quick about, it or
      I'll tell on ye&mdash;hope t' die if I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was to me a large sum, for my income was only four dollars and
      twenty-five cents a month. But my fear of ridicule had the persuasiveness
      of a thumb-screw. I had two dollars and nineteen cents that I had been
      saving for the fair at Heartsdale. With great solemnity I took the
      two-dollar bill out of my pocket and put it in the hand of my oppressor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going for a drive to-night,&rdquo; he said, as he took the money. &ldquo;It's a
      matter of business that 'll pay me pretty well, and I may need some help.
      Come along, and I'll pay you back the money I've borrowed and a dollar
      besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, down the country about fifteen miles. I'm going to get a Bungwood cow
      for a friend o' mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Bungwood cow!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An imported breed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and the best in the world. They're frisky
      and a little dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That seemed to me rather curious, but, then, I did not know much about
      cows. It was a greater compliment than I had ever received&mdash;the
      invitation of this imperial and heroic figure; but I concealed my joy with
      a look of calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you coming back?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jaunty fellow crossed the floor, rattling his change and singing, &ldquo;Oh,
      we won't go home till morning!&rdquo; He turned quickly and said, with a sober
      face: &ldquo;I'll get ye here in good season. Tell 'em you're going to stay with
      a friend, an' will be back in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lied about it, for I knew that Mr. Weatherby had no high opinion of Bony
      Squares, and got permission to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o'clock that evening I set out for the corner below Mill Pond,
      where Bony, with a horse and a buckboard, was to wait for me. There he
      was, and away we went; and the horse's hoofs beat time for a lively ditty
      sung by my new friend. The chill night fell, and a sense of sadness and
      regret was in me. To what place he drove, or how long it took him to get
      there, I know not even now. After a long time I fell asleep. A rude shake
      and the light of a lantern awoke me. I got out of the buggy in a shed back
      of a little church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for a boat-ride,&rdquo; said my companion; &ldquo;then a short drive, and we'll
      be on our way home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the cow, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed him a few rods to the shore of a great river. A man stood in a
      boat near by, as if waiting for us. I had never seen so much water; it
      sped and shimmered in the moonlight far from shore, and beyond was the
      mystery of the night. The loud voices of the river filled me with awe, and
      our boat creaked and swerved in roaring currents, and the boatman grew
      weary with his struggle, and breathed like a spent horse by and by. I knew
      it was the St. Lawrence, and wondered if he were going to swim the cow
      through its whirlpools and rapids.
    </p>
    <p>
      We landed safely by-and-by, and followed the boatman through thick woods.
      There was a road just beyond them in the edge of the open. We turned into
      it, and a moment's walk brought us to another stage in the mystery. There,
      under a tree by the roadside, were a horse and wagon. For half a moment
      Bony stood whispering to the boatman. Then, turning quickly, he said,
      &ldquo;Jump in&mdash;we've no time to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaped to the seat beside me, gave the horse a cut, and we sped away on
      a road which he seemed to know. We drove for half an hour or so, and drew
      up at a large building. A lighted candle was burning in a window near the
      front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bony got out of the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me take your watch,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I want to keep track o' the time.
      We haven't long to stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I handed him the gold watch and chain which had belonged to my father, and
      which I was permitted to wear. They were to me precious above all value. I
      had some misgivings, but who could resist Bony Squares?
    </p>
    <p>
      He fastened the chain upon his waistcoat, mounted the steps, rapped, and
      was soon admitted. Presently a big man came out of an open shed, which was
      part of the building, and put half a barrel and two demijohns into the
      wagon-box behind me. In a moment Bony came to the door and whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come an' have a bite,&rdquo; he said to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was chilled to the bone, and my teeth were chattering as I climbed the
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crackers and cheese and a box of sardines, newly opened, lay on the
      counter of a store, crowded with merchandise and rank with many odors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bony stood eating. Now and then he took a sip of liquor from a small
      glass. He and the storekeeper spoke in low tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another drop 'll warm ye,&rdquo; said the storekeeper, as he poured more for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's as good as a hot stove,&rdquo; said Bony, tipping his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon we returned to the river and recrossed it with what Bony called &ldquo;the
      cow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silently, hurriedly, we put our horse in the shafts and made off on a
      smooth road. The moon had set, and we could not see our way. Bony let the
      horse have his head and hurried him along. Suddenly, in the near darkness,
      some one shouted: &ldquo;Halt! Halt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bony's whip fell savagely on the back of the horse, and the latter took
      the first leap in a wild run. For half a minute we were in a bad mess, and
      knew not how we were coming out of it. Pistols roared on both sides of us,
      and bullets whizzed above our heads. For possibly three minutes we flew
      down the dark road, our front wheels leaving ground with every jump. Then
      suddenly it seemed as if the stars were falling on us. We had struck
      something. The horse went down, and we plunged headlong into the darkness.
      I rose unhurt, and ran around the wagon just as Bony got up with a groan.
      We could hear our pursuers coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; my companion whispered. &ldquo;We must take to the woods or go to
      jail. You're in it as deep as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated in a sort of panic. My head was hot and more incapable than
      ever. One allpowerful thought moved me: Bony had my watch and chain, and
      was making off with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; fool&mdash;they'll shoot us down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bony whispered, and I followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were in the midst of a strip of woods, and went bumping the
      tree-columns on our way-through it. We had come into an open field when we
      heard our pursuers shouting, back where the horse fell. We ran like
      frightened sheep, and slowed our pace beyond the top of a hill and began
      to walk. We tramped for an hour in silence. The sky was clearing, and we
      could discern the rocks and stones and fences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going any farther,&rdquo; I said, stopping suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go back, then,&rdquo; said Bony Squares. &ldquo;You've gone and got me into a
      nice scrape,&rdquo; I declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better git sore on me&mdash;ye saphead!&rdquo; said Bony, with contempt. &ldquo;As if
      I expected to do anything but give ye a dollar an' a good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't have anything to do with your smuggling,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If I'd known
      you were in that kind of business I wouldn't have been with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, ye cry-baby! Wasn't ye in the wagon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's enough&mdash;the goods was in the wagon, an' so was you an'
      so was me. All they have to do is to ketch ye with the goods. If ye didn't
      know what I was up to, what did ye run for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between tears and perspiration I felt as if I were melting and running
      down at the top like a tallow-candle. But I held myself up manfully, and
      not a whimper came out of me. I had become a fugitive in spite of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess they wouldn't do much to us if we did go home,&rdquo; I said,
      tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;ye Mary chaser! They wouldn't do much more than take us up
      before we got a mile on the way. Then me an' you to jail, an' yer mother'd
      have to pay a thousand dollars to git us out. My folks ain't got any
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment of silence followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ye go an' let out on me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I'll swear, by all that's black
      an' blue, that you were in the game for a part of the profits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me my watch and chain!&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless you'll promise to stay by me till we're safe,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I promised, and so the watch and chain were returned to me then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw through the low cunning of Bony. He had drawn me into his enterprise
      for the sake of getting my mother's help in case of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was growing light, and we soon came out on a smooth road, and walked
      along it for half a mile or so. Just before the sun rose we came to a man
      milking in a field by the highway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho! peaches an' cream!&rdquo; said Bony, as he vaulted the fence. I
      followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're lost, broke, an' starving,&rdquo; said he to the stranger. &ldquo;Mind giving
      us a little fresh-laid milk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you'll have to take it out o' the pail,&rdquo; the milker answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just give me hold o' the tin,&rdquo; said Bony, with glad eyes. He blew back
      the froth and drank like a famished horse. He stopped for breath and
      whispered: &ldquo;Peaches and cream? Yes, kind lady,&rdquo; and drank more. Again he
      rested, smiling, as he added: &ldquo;Ham and eggs? Yes, if you please, with a
      cup o' coffee,&rdquo; and continued his feast. Soon he passed the pail to me,
      and I took a good drink. Then we went on across the field, climbed a
      fence, and proceeded on our way. We left the road by walking in the bed of
      a brook, so that no one could follow our footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a big world,&rdquo; said Bony. &ldquo;If we keep out o' the way awhile it 'll
      blow over and we can settle for a song, and everything 'll be all hunk.
      We'll pike off West, where we can go to work for big wages, and I'll show
      ye something o' the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought presented a great temptation, for I longed to see Niagara
      Falls, of which the Pearl had told me.

      E came to broad fields, where the brook we had followed wound through many
      acres of wheat. It stood thick and high as my shoulders, for I was rather
      small of my age, and rustled in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's our hotel,&rdquo; said Bony, as he began to wade in the brook again.
      &ldquo;We'll find our rooms and put up for the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Far out in this yellowing field we climbed the bank of the stream, and on
      our hands and knees crawled in among the wheat-stalks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Bony Squares as he lay back in the wheat; &ldquo;no ice-water, thank
      you. Call me at seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lay down near, and soon heard him breathing heavily as he fell asleep. I
      looked up through the grain at a little patch of the blue sky, and thought
      and listened.

    <p>
      The great field rang with the chirp of crickets, that somehow set me
      thinking of my folly. It was a curious, beautiful country there, beneath
      the grain. Leaning on my elbow, I could look off under its green empyrean,
      supported by innumerable columns. There were little roads and trails, and
      a mouse came galloping up one of them. It suggested a forest of the
      fairies. A small bird went by me wandering in a little highway with the
      leisurely pace of a hen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could hear a bobolink singing just above my head, and then the whir of
      his wings. Soon he seized a swaying stalk&mdash;one foot above another&mdash;on
      the very edge of my bed, and as he rocked back and forth filled the breeze
      with song. A bumblebee, which had fallen through the wheat-blades, rose
      here and there and tried to ram his way upward into the sunlight. The roar
      of his wings reminded me of the big side-wheeler which had passed us the
      night before on the river. It suggested thunder in the low, green heavens
      above that little world. Innumerable bearded tops, now bleaching yellow,
      made a sort of Ã¦olian music in the breeze. It has often seemed to me that
      the birds have better ears for it than we; that, indeed, the fields are
      full of bells and harps and fragrance and color far beyond the reach of
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon I began to think of my mother. She was away on a visit, and would not
      hear of my absence for a day or two. I had nineteen cents in my pocket,
      and took it in my hands and counted it carefully. But I had my horruck in
      a hidden pocket of my waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as soon as possible I would stop somewhere and write my mother a
      letter, and let her know what had befallen me. I felt sure that by
      returning I should make her more trouble than by keeping away. She had
      often described to me the perils of bad company, and I had promised to be
      careful, but here I was up to my ears in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mercy that sleep came to shorten that cloudless summer day. The
      hot sun mounted high, and for a time must have glared down straight upon
      us, and then descended below far wooded hills in the west; but still we
      slept. It was growing dusk when I was awakened by the roar of a bird's
      wings. Bony was on his knees within reach of my hand, looking down at me.
      A bird kept dipping close to the ears of my companion and snapping his
      wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bony took a bun from his pocket, and crowded half of it into his mouth. It
      stuck out like a wen, and slowly diminished as he ate. He renewed his wen,
      saying as he did so:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to supper, old man. The buns are all gone. Have some bread?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was hungry, and promptly answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plug or fine cut?&rdquo; he demanded, taking crumbs of varying sizes out of his
      hip-pocket. &ldquo;Here's bread and two pieces of turnpike cheese, and one egg
      on the half-shell, and three spikes.&rdquo; The three spikes were dried herring,
      which he had taken out of his trousers-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Maria!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he took a bite of herring; &ldquo;it's like
      eating a jack-knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke glibly, and spread each article on a piece of newspaper in front
      of us. My tongue was parched, and I went to the brook on my hands and
      knees, and sank my mouth in the ripples and drank greedily, as if I had
      been a creature of four feet. I never knew there could be so much delight
      in the simple act of drinking water.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ate two herrings and half of the cheese, and all the crumbs that fell,
      as it were, from the rich man's table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly we heard the whistle of a locomotive. &ldquo;There's a railroad nigh,&rdquo;
       said Bony. &ldquo;Ever ride on the cars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, hundreds o' miles!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with disgust at the question.
      &ldquo;Come on; maybe we can get that train. It was four or five miles away when
      it whistled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We hurried off in the dusk, and after walking a mile or so came to a
      railroad, and could see the lights of a depot near us. We mounted the
      wooden beams which, with straps of iron on their tops for a bearing, were
      the tracks of those days, and hurried to a point near the depot. There we
      sat down and waited in the darkness till the arrival of our train&mdash;a
      fearsome thing, that roared and creaked along with spark-showers and rags
      of flame in the air above it. The trainmen rudely shouted their commands,
      as if the waiting crowd were so many cattle. I trembled as I hurried with
      Bony to the side of the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've only nineteen cents,&rdquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, sonny&mdash;I'll pay yer fare,&rdquo; said he, jauntily, as if such
      excitement and generosity were quite familiar to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We climbed the platform when all were aboard, and Bony said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll stand here, if they don't kick us off, until we get to the next
      stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we stood in the spark-shower as our train roared and creaked along, and
      the platform began to sway and jump and shove and jerk and waver. A young
      man in a gay uniform of blue and brass came out with a lantern and bawled
      this in my ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look a-here, bub!&mdash;see that picture?&rdquo; He held his lantern so that I
      could see the picture of a grave on the car door. Its headstone contained
      these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sacred to the memory of a man who once stood on a car platform</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      We passed into the car, and sat on a straight-backed seat by a rattling
      window. It was much shorter than the cars of to-day, and permeated with
      the odor of whale-oil that came from its lamps, and had a stove at each
      end. The conductor told us, when we had paid four cents a mile for our
      fare to the next stop, that we had just left De Kalb Junction and were on
      the night express for the South. A man was asleep near us with a curious
      framework of iron behind him. It extended from the middle of his spine to
      the back of his head, and had a sort of spring in it which permitted him
      to sit in a leaning posture.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked the conductor what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is one o' them new contrivances. Some call it a
      jolt-taker. It smoothes the way a little and is an aid to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Bony whispered to me: &ldquo;The coast is clear, and I guess we'll
      go on a little farther, and I'll pay your fare if you'll give me your
      jack-knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had one which had cost me ten shillings, and I gave it over. So we rode
      on for some two hours or more, and left the train about ten o'clock, and
      inquired our way of the agent, and then went on afoot. It was very dark,
      and Bony said that the moon would be up by-and-by, then we could find a
      barn or some place where we could turn in for the night. We had smooth
      footing, and hurried on, but no moon came to guide us. It was far past
      midnight when Bony halted, near some black object beside the road, and
      struck a match and lighted a wad of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw, then, a ruined gate and weeds growing beyond it. I followed as my
      leader went in among the weeds. He lighted more paper, and we saw in the
      flare an old mansion with broken windows and a sagging porch. It had been
      long deserted, one could tell at a glance. We soon found the open doorway
      and entered, and Bony's matches showed us a ruined hall as large as my
      mother's door-yard. A broken fireplace and cracked chimney of red brick
      faced the door. A plough and harrow, some fallen plaster, and old iron
      littered the floor. A pair of sleighs, with a box on them, had been stored
      in a corner. Some straw in the bottom of the sleigh-box seemed to invite
      us to lie upon it, and we did so. Bony took off his coat and spread it
      over him&mdash;a good thing to remember if one has no better blanket&mdash;and
      I followed his example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; I whispered, having heard a sound like that of some one
      stealthily crossing the floor above-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know&mdash;I guess Adam must 'a' built this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haunted, maybe,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Probably some one has been murdered here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; said Bony, with a shiver. &ldquo;You'll give me the megrums.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lay awhile listening, and went to sleep cold and hungry. I do not know
      how long I had slept&mdash;it was, probably, not more than half an hour&mdash;when
      a shrill and awful cry awoke us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Believe me, I have heard some yelling in my day, but that cry cut like a
      knife. As I think of it now, it reminds me of Salvini's wail when I saw
      him play the Ghost in <i>Hamlet</i>. Honestly, it made my heart tremble.
      That sleigh-box seemed to palpitate with terror. I rose on my elbow and
      looked off in the darkness. Bony covered his face and trembled. For a
      moment I could hear only the slow, steady beat of raindrops; then stealthy
      footsteps and the sound of trailing garments on the floor. Again that
      weird, ghostly cry set my ears aching. I could feel each hair in my scalp
      stir and quiver. I heard again the sound of stealthy feet and of trailing
      garments. Then we heard the shaking of a sheet in the darkness&mdash;or
      that, at least, was the only sound to which one could liken it. Bony lay
      groaning and shivering beside me. I found a match and struck it on a side
      of the sleigh-box. First, I stared off in the darkness and saw nothing;
      then I looked down at my companion. His face appalled me; it was the mask
      of horror. But the glimpse he got of my own visage in the dim match-light
      had a worse effect upon him. He really saw a spirit then, and I saw one
      also, and what I saw was a fearful thing to behold&mdash;the guilty, evil
      spirit of Bony Squares. I could hardly resist the impulse to fly from him.
      With a wild cry he leaped out of the sleigh-box and stumbled toward the
      doorway and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay back and covered my face with my coat. For hours I lay listening and
      shivering, and fearing I knew not what.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the faint, first light of the morning I rose and peered about me. Soon
      I saw the silhouette of a big bird in an open window across the ruined
      hall. The light grew clearer and my vision more acute. The bird that stood
      on the window-sill was a peacock, with a purple body and a tail some seven
      feet long. As I rose it flew to the ground, with that weird shriek which
      had filled the darkness with terror. The mystery was explained. There were
      the trailing garments, the wings that rustled like a sheet when he rose to
      the window-sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      This adventure served, as it were, to separate me from the goats. There
      was yet another thing which it accomplished: it cleared the earth of
      ghosts for me, so that I no longer feared them, having always a just
      suspicion of such fancies.

      TOOK the road again, faint with hunger. I tell you, one will have faith in
      the goodness of men and women who makes a journey like that of mine. I
      remember it almost broke me down to go to a farm-house and face the good
      woman who opened the door and ask for a chance to earn my breakfast. When
      I spoke to her, there must have been something in my voice and countenance
      not to be denied or even rudely dealt with. I got all that I needed and
      more, and went on my way with a bundle of luncheon and a heart full of
      gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was shining out of a clear sky behind me, and I knew that I was
      travelling in the right direction. The white-throated sparrow sang on a
      wooded slope:
    </p>

    <p>
      The sidings were aglow with goldenrod and bluebells, and the breeze had a
      musky breath, and every bush was a fountain of song. I posted a letter to
      my mother in a little hamlet through which I passed about ten o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near noon I overtook a boy some two or three years older than myself. He
      had a wooden leg&mdash;a rude stump on which his knee rested&mdash;and
      walked with a grip in his hand. He was a rugged, serious-looking boy, with
      a face browned by the sunlight. He asked for my name and &ldquo;place of
      residence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a commercial traveller,&rdquo; he informed me, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you sell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down an' I'll show ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat on the grass together, and he opened his grip. It was full of round
      white balls, differing in size and neatly wrapped in tinted tissue-paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he answered., with dignity. &ldquo;That, sir, is Sal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sal?&rdquo; said I
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sal,&rdquo; said he, with a fond look at one of the white balls which now lay
      in his hand. &ldquo;Sal cleans and polishes silverware, glassware, gold, brass,
      and pewter; removes dirt from woodwork and makes the home bright and
      beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke this lingo as if it were some passage from a book of poetry, and
      paused to note its effect upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your line?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm on my way West to find employment,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like to take Sal with you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; was my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll sell you the receipt for a dollar,&rdquo; said the boy with a wooden leg.
      &ldquo;Fifty cents' worth of material will make a hundred balls. They sell like
      hot cakes&mdash;ten cents for the small sizes, twenty-five for the large.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't much money&mdash;only sixteen cents,&rdquo; I answered, with
      embarrassment, remembering that I had just paid three cents for postage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked me over from head to foot, and said, &ldquo;I'll trust ye, if ye'd
      like to try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his little grip and counted out ten of the small balls and as
      many large ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ye ought to be able to sell 'em all in a day. Then you
      can send me a dollar for the receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you go to work to sell it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The towns are best,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When I get to a town I make a little map
      of the main streets and put down the names&mdash;the hotel man is always
      glad to help you. By-an'-by I begin to ring the door-bells. I don't ask
      for the lady of the house&mdash;no, sir; I say, 'Is Mrs. Smith at home?'
      It works grand&mdash;there she is. 'Kind lady,' says I, 'I'm introducin'
      Sal, who cleans silverware, glassware, etc. Sal is better than a hired
      girl.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't forget to say that it makes the home bright and beautiful. It's a
      nice chunk o' language an' tells just what the women are trying to do.
      Course she says, 'No, thanks.' Then says I, 'If you've any old piece o'
      tarnished silver, I'd like to make a little exhibition. As the poet says:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      '&ldquo;I'll make it shine
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As brightly as those eyes of thine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw in a little portry once in a while. It sounds good an' is easy to
      remember. But ye got to be careful. Some don't like it. Women that wear
      aprons an' rings an' breastpins, an' have their sleeves rolled up, 'll
      generally stand portry, 'specially if they've got curly hair. Look out for
      handsome women that wear diamonds an' set around with their feet up
      readin' portry.' Seems so them that read portry get enough of it. Don't
      ever give 'em any of yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women are funny. Around here there's two kinds of 'em&mdash;insiders an'
      outsiders. The outsiders talk about their neighbors; the insiders talk
      about their livers an' lungs, an' so on. I know one that talks about her
      liver shameful. You'd think it was the meanest thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ain't all alike. In some places you'll find 'em perched in their
      fam'ly trees. Lord! I know one that sets an' chirps by the hour in her
      fam'ly tree. You've got to let her go it, an' bym-by, maybe, you can bring
      her down to the fam'ly tea-pot. If so, you're all right. It's wonderful
      how they go on. You'll enjoy it, an' that's half the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure to notice the children. I always let 'em fool with my wooden leg.
      Sometimes I put one end on a chair an' let 'em set on it. I suppose this
      old leg has been set on an' abused more than any leg in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't got a wooden leg, an' it's kind of a pity, as ye might say, for
      it's wonderful how this thing helps in business. Lots o' times it helps ye
      git acquainted, an' that gives ye a chance. Then say, look a-there.&rdquo; He
      flung his wooden stump over his knee and felt the surface of it, and
      explained: &ldquo;That's where one kid drove a nail in it, an' that's where one
      fetched a whack with a stove iron, an' there a little red-headed boy bored
      a hole with his gimlet. Curious how they take to it; an' I don't mind
      much. Helps business an' makes 'em happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called my attention to many small dents in the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's where the dogs has bit it,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;If a dog comes at me, I
      always put it out to him. It keeps 'em busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He showed me a small atomizer, adding, &ldquo;A little ammonia 'll shift the
      trouble onto them.&rdquo; We rose and resumed our journey. I had stored my small
      stock of Sal in my coat-pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the receipt,&rdquo; said he, gravely, as he handed me a piece of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It revealed the fact that Sal was chiefly composed of whiting and ammonia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ye need now is a small sponge an' some tissue-paper, an' here's a
      piece o' chamois that ye can have an' welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He explained his method of applying the Sal, and presently handed me his
      card, on which I read this legend:

      &ldquo;I ain't much there,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;The boys call me Pegleg at home, an'
      that's one reason I got out. I wish you'd call me Mr. McCarthy, please. I
      intend to be a gentleman, an' try to be. Can you tell me what a gentleman
      is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked thoughtful and said nothing. Mr. McCarthy continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a man that don't git drunk or swear or pare his nails in public, an'
      always takes off his hat to a lady. He washes his hands before he goes to
      the table, an' eats kind o' slow an' deliberate, an' maybe smokes a fine
      cigar after dinner, 'an always does as he'd like to be done by. That's why
      I'm tryin' to help you along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I expressed my gratitude in no half-hearted way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you, dinged if I don't,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy, with a kindly
      patronage. &ldquo;You'll git along all right&mdash;don't worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment of silence, he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, I'm careful about all these things. I keep my eyes an' ears open,
      an' I'm teachin' myself. I'm a kind of a hand-made gentleman, an' that's
      the most durable kind. But I ain't finished myself yet. You wait; I'll
      show ye something one o' these days. How do you happen to be on the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Mr. James Henry McCarthy will see you through.
      I try to be benevolent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We walked on a little way in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you've noticed that I can sling some rather big words,&rdquo; he
      remarked, presently. &ldquo;Well, I always carry a pocket dictionary, an' when I
      hear a word I like I look it up an' chalk it down in my note-book; helps
      my conversation. I study it a good deal while I'm travelling. Ye see, I
      never had a chance to go to school much&mdash;just learnt how to read an'
      write an' cipher a little. My knowledge ain't very superior. Now, that's
      quite a word&mdash;superior. How does it sound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never used it before&mdash;found it in the book to-day. I've got about
      forty dollars saved, an' I've learnt thirty new words so 't I can use 'em.
      When I go home by-an'-by they've got to look up to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The oddness of it all was not lost upon me, young as I was. I think often
      of the frankness of that young son of America, just beginning to feel his
      way upward from the plane of lowly poverty and of his kindly heart. I
      dreamed not then of what he was to do in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into this house with me,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy. &ldquo;I'll give ye an
      exposition&mdash;ahem! that's one o' my new ones. Pretty fair kind of a
      farm-house. Wouldn't wonder if there was some old silver in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led me to the front door of a big, square, old country mansion. A maid
      opened the door and asked to know our business. Mr. McCarthy removed his
      hat and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please communicate with the lady of the house,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an'
      tell her that I am selling Sal? Kindly inform her that Sal cleans
      silverware, glassware, gold, brass, and pewter; removes dirt from
      woodwork, and makes the home bright and beautiful. If you've any old
      silver I'd like to show ye what it 'll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid brought him a tarnished tea-pot, and McCarthy went to work and
      soon made it glow like a drop of dew in the sunlight. The maid took it to
      her mistress, and returned presently with fifty cents to be invested in
      Sal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just wanted to show ye what Sal can do,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy, as we went
      away. &ldquo;Ye got to believe what ye say or ye can't sell anything. Make
      yourself believe in it, an' you'll succeed.&rdquo; We came presently to four
      corners in the road, where my new friend bade me sit down with him. He
      consulted his note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are Jehoshaphat Corners. The straight road goes to
      Canaan, Waterville, and Van Kleek's Huddle; the left to Putney,
      Porridgeville, and Lawrence. You take one road an' I'll take the other,
      an' four weeks from now we could meet an' settle up at Graham's Hotel in
      Buffalo. It's only a dollar a day there. Here, I'll lend ye fifty cents;
      it 'll help some till ye get a-going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're very kind, and I thank you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mention it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It's no more than any gentleman would do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we parted there, and I took the straight road and he turned to the
      left.

      WAS lonely at leaving Mr. McCarthy, but full of hope. At Canaan I went to
      work and sold about half my stock of goods and took the cars to
      Waterville. There I bought a small hand-bag and a stock of ingredients for
      my receipt, and had just left my hotel next morning to begin my canvass
      when a trumpet sounded up the main street of the little city. Turning, I
      saw a caravan of great red wagons coming toward me at a swift pace, led by
      four beautiful white horses. A smart-looking lady and gentleman occupied
      the high seat of the first van, and he was driving the white horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A circus!&rdquo; I heard people exclaim near me, and every foot halted and all
      eyes were bent on the red vans. They were fast approaching. The driver
      referred to wore a white beaver hat and a coat of blue velvet with a white
      flower in its buttonhole. The lady beside him was a wonderful creature
      with a great hat and fluttering ribbons and gleaming jewels, and a face
      more beautiful, as I thought, than any my poor eyes had seen. Three
      glowing vans had gone by, each with its team of handsome horses, and each
      van ornately lettered as follows:

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A white banner on the first and third vans announced:

      of Crosby and Main Streets
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I began my work, and for an hour or so the vans were passing up and down
      the streets, and most of the women I saw left me to go and look out of
      their doors and windows. I could make little headway, for by two o'clock
      the houses were all empty. Mothers, daughters, and hired girls were on
      their way to the great travelling store. I went with the crowd, and found
      the red vans in a row on the vacant lot and many gathered about them. The
      sides of each van had been let down to serve as counters on which the
      goods were displayed. The smart-looking man who had driven the white
      horses sat under a little canopy of red-and-white bunting with the
      wonderful lady who had ridden beside him. I stood with a score of other
      people looking at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! do you think I would lie for a shilling?&rdquo; he was saying to a man
      who stood beside him. &ldquo;Bosh! I might tell eight lies for a dollar, but one
      for a shilling! No! That's below my price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid off his beaver hat and sat twisting his' sandy-hued mustache. His
      curly hair was cut close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, boy!&rdquo; he said, as he beckoned to me, &ldquo;want to earn half a dollar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, trot down to the depot and bring me a copy of last night's <i>Utica
      Observer</i>,&rdquo; he commanded, as he put a shinplaster in my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had returned with the paper, he asked, &ldquo;What ye got in yer grip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sal,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sal!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a laugh, &ldquo;who's Sal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wonder!&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Cleans and polishes glassware, silverware, gold,
      brass, and pewter; removes dirt from woodwork, and makes the home bright
      and beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again, and asked me to show him what Sal could do on the large
      silver buckles which adorned his shoes. This I did, and the result so
      pleased him that he offered me a dollar for the balance of my stock, and I
      gladly closed the deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about three o'clock when I set out afoot for the Huddle. About
      half-way there I found a puppy in the road&mdash;a small, lonely, pathetic
      creature, abandoned by some one who had had enough of him. I wonder if
      ever I felt such an appeal as came out of that warm little bundle of
      playfulness, wrapped in the softest robe of silken fur and with eyes
      saying, &ldquo;Please, sir, take me and be kind to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The puppy followed me until I yielded to his pleading and took him up in
      my arms. Well, he was better than no company, and I buttoned him under my
      coat and against my breast, where he lay asleep with only his nose in
      view. At dusk I found lodgings in a farm-house, and went to my room
      contented with the bit of luncheon that I had with me. A kindly old woman
      had said that I could stay, and sent a hired man up-stairs with me. He
      explained that &ldquo;the boss and his wife&rdquo; were away, and would not return for
      an hour or so. I offered to pay him if he would take care of the puppy,
      but he had to hurry to meet a train, and said that he would come up and
      get him later.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to make some Sal, and so I put the ingredients in my wash-bowl
      and added water.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became an obstinate, ill-looking mess, and one might as well have tried
      to make balls out of buttermilk. It resisted all my efforts. I wondered
      what I should do with it, and lay down upon the bed in discouragement. The
      hired man had not yet returned, and the puppy had gone to sleep in a
      corner. I would lie there and rest while I waited, and so, thinking, fell
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours later the puppy woke me with loud cries of despair. The hired,
      man must have forgotten his promise. I rose from the bed, and saw the
      plight of my puppy. He had wallowed in my basin, and the soft Sal lay
      thick on his body. He began wailing as if wild with all regret. I could
      hear people jumping out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment I heard a rap at my door, and opened it. A man, half dressed,
      sprang aside as the puppy ran upon his bare feet. Farther down the gloomy
      hall I could hear him calling and pursuing my pet; then a soft thud on the
      floor. The man had picked up the puppy and dropped him, saying, &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo;
       It was only one word, but full of meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to clean the floor while my benefactors pursued the unhappy
      creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pick him up!&rdquo; said a woman, excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pick him up! Never!&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems so he was covered with lather,&rdquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he's mad!&rdquo; another suggested. &ldquo;Throw this sheet over him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, I've got him now,&rdquo; said the first woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon there came a loud rap at my door. A tall, thin, long-nosed Yankee
      entered as I opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, young man,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;what do you mean by fillin' this house
      with puppies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one, sir,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one!&rdquo; said he, sharply. &ldquo;I should think that was enough. He's as big
      as an elephant. He filled the house from cellar to garret, and crowded us
      all out o' bed and yelled for more room. Say, what's he got on him?&rdquo;
       '&ldquo;Silver polish,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silver polish!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Well, I've read o' their puttin' dogs in a
      bath-tub, but I never heard o' their bein' polished before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got into the basin where I mixed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My visitor picked up the dish of soft Sal, and held it near the light for
      examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfrey Cordial!&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;it's an awful-lookin' mess! What do you
      call it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sal,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sal!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I'm sorry that you an' Sal ever lit in my family
      tree. You're a fine pair o' birds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I explained to him that the hired man had promised to take the puppy
      out-of-doors, but had forgotten to do so, and he left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to breakfast soon after daylight in the morning. When I returned to
      my room the Sal was gone. Some one had carried the bowl away with its
      contents. I went below to look for the proprietor. I found him shovelling
      dirt in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody took my polish,&rdquo; I said to him, as pleasantly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, an' I'm about to bury it an' the dog, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the dog dead?&rdquo; I asked, with a pang of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; slain by his own deviltry! Oh, he had a busy night! Got to playin'
      with our ol' cat; he polished her an' she polished him. Her paws are all
      gummed up an' her eyes swelled an' kind o' shiny. He got at our shepherd
      dog an' polished him. That dog has got a sore mouth an' is brighter than
      he ever was before, The last performance of your puppy was to tackle one
      o' the hind feet o' my ol' mare; he didn't live long after that. The
      services have begun, an' I guess you're the only mourner. I've just prayed
      that I may never see him again. The sermon will be short. Don't ever take
      up any more room in the world than what you're entitled to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So ended my first adventure in business. It taught me the wisdom of
      knowing how, and of being sure about it, and, further, that one is to be
      careful not to take more than his share of room in the world.

      HE farmer in whose house I had spent the night was a thrifty man of the
      name of Ephraim Baker. My hope in Sal having been overthrown, I offered
      him my services. I had had enough of disappointment and uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't look stout,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but you ought to be able to mow away an'
      rake after.&rdquo; Well, I made a bargain with him, and went to work at once. My
      first task was to lead a great bull to water. He stood in the stable with
      a ring in his nose, and roared as I took him out. It was like leading a
      thunder-storm, but I thought of what General Washington would have done,
      and walked without flinching. I was surprised to see how easily I could
      handle the big bull with that ring in his nose. After this initiation the
      harvesters&mdash;big, cordy fellows&mdash;tried to bury me in the mow.
      They always did that with a fresh hand, &ldquo;to see what he was made of.&rdquo;
       Well, I kept my head and shoulders above the grain, although they had
      given me a fork with three corners on the stale. It was a hard pace they
      set me, and I lay down at night like a wounded soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slept with the hired man, who had taken me to my room when I arrived,
      with all my pride upon me. He was a big, friendly fellow with bristling
      red hair, who bore the proud, sonorous name of Sam. He had forgotten to
      remove the puppy&mdash;so he said&mdash;and thought it all an excellent
      joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He indulged in autobiography as I lay yawning&mdash;led me through his
      career to romantic scenes where he first met his girl and &ldquo;took a shine to
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wished,&rdquo; said he, after a moment of silence, &ldquo;that you'd write a letter
      for me which I could copy and send to her. I want it worded right up to
      the mark. You've got learnin', an' will know how to write a good,
      respectable, high-toned letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I agreed to do my best for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baker called us at four, and we dressed and went into the garden and
      dug potatoes until breakfast-time. So each day began, its work continuing
      in field, mow, and milking-yard until dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next evening, when we went to our room, with pen and ink I sat down to
      write the letter for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Miss Fannie Comstock, Summerville, New York,&rdquo; he dictated, in a
      whisper. &ldquo;Dear Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat a moment thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her I ain't forgot her,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and that I am well an' hope
      you're the same, an' so on an' so forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I began the letter as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Miss,&mdash;It is only a month since we parted, but it has been the
      longest month in my life, and although I am far away it will surprise you
      to learn that I see you often. I see you in the fields every day and in my
      dreams every night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think that will do,&rdquo; he demurred, soberly, when I read it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; was my query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it don't seem as if it was exactly proper an' good sense,&rdquo; he
      continued, in all seriousness. &ldquo;The month ain't had any more 'n thirty-one
      days in it&mdash;that's sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried again with better understanding, and this came of it:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Miss,&mdash;I write these lines to let you know that I am well and
      that I haven't forgotten you. I hope that you are well and that you
      haven't forgotten me. I am working on a farm, and am as happy as could be
      expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good,&rdquo; said he, when I read it to him; and added, proudly, with
      his finger on the unfinished line, &ldquo;Wages, thirty dollars a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did as he wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now go on,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Throw in a big word once in a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you going to say anything about love?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;A little poem
      might please her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go light on that,&rdquo; he answered, doubtfully. &ldquo;She's respectable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is a trait of the common clay of which Sam was made to consider love a
      thing to be reluctantly, if ever, confessed. When the grand passion showed
      itself in his conduct it was greeted with jeers and rude laughter. It
      became, therefore, a hidden, timid thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;she can't be more respectable than love and
      poetry. If you love her you ought not to be ashamed of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, throw in a little if you think best,&rdquo; he yielded, &ldquo;but do it
      careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the letter continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately I've been saving my money. Perhaps you can guess why. I want a home
      and some one to help me make it happy, and I believe I've found her. She
      is good and beautiful, and all that a woman should be. Do you want to know
      who it is? Well, that's a secret. She's a lady, and that's all I will tell
      you now. Fannie, you're a friend of mine, and I need your advice. I am a
      little frightened and don't know just what to say to her, and you could
      make it easy for me if you would. Please let me know when I can see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam shook his head and laughed and exclaimed, &ldquo;That's business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's love,&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it ain't foolish or unproper, an' it sounds kind o' comical. She'll
      want to know all about it. Put in that I'm goin' to take a farm an' be my
      own boss, an' have as good a horse an' buggy as any one. That makes it
      kind o' temptin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did as he wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now say, 'Yours truly, with respect,'&rdquo; said he, and so my task was ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later he came to me in high spirits, with a letter in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm goin' to see Fannie to-morrow,&rdquo; he said, in a whisper. &ldquo;If Sam
      Whittemore can do anything for you, I want to know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His opportunity came that evening. I was doing my chores in the barn.
      Suddenly Sam burst upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're after you!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two men in a buggy&mdash;they've heard you were here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had told him of my trouble, and now it threatened to engulf me. Would I
      give myself up and go home with the officers? I could not bear the thought
      of going home like a felon. It would kill my mother. This all flashed
      through my brain in a jiffy, while the dusk air seemed to be full of
      chains and handcuffs. I started to climb a ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use,&rdquo; said he, as he picked up an empty sack. &ldquo;They know you're here.
      Get into this sack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wagon stood on the barn floor loaded with potatoes, in big sacks. Sam
      was holding the empty sack. I stepped into it and sat with my chin between
      my knees while he stuffed a bundle of straw all around me. Then he cut two
      holes near the top of the sack, to give me air and an outlook, tied it
      above my head, and flung me on the load of potatoes. It was all done in
      the shake of a lamb's tail, as they used to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man is going to drive to Sackett's Harbor to-night with these
      potatoes,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You go on to Summerville; I'll meet you there
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he left me, and I lay quietly on the load.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn't in there,&rdquo; I heard him say, on his way to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, they did some searching and tramping about for the next half-hour or
      so. By-and-by they put the team on the wagon-pole, and we began our
      journey&mdash;the potatoes and I. They nudged me while the wagon rattled
      over stones in the stable-yard, as if they wished me to move along; but we
      came soon to smoother going. Darkness had fallen, and through the
      peep-holes in my sack I could see moonlight and a small section of the
      Milky Way. My discomfort set me to work planning relief. I drew the new
      jack-knife, which I had bought in my one day of plenty, and cut two long
      slits in the bottom of the sack and gave my feet their freedom. With my
      legs protruding a sense of the dearness of life returned to me. Two more
      slits in the sack enabled me to put my arms out and to move freely on the
      load. I lay quietly for an hour or so, and then thought I would try
      sitting up. So I rose and adjusted my peep-holes and stared about me. My
      employer sat on one end of the seat, singing. Soon I could hear only the
      creak of the whiffletrees and the rattle of the wheels. The reins, which
      were looped over a shoulder, fell limp, and he began to snore.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could hear the distant roar of a railroad train. It was coming nearer,
      and where was the crossing? A sense of prudence caused me to climb to the
      seat and take the reins. I did this gently, and without waking him. I had
      a fear of falling in with more officers, and kept my sack on me and
      listened for teams. If I should hear one coming I would resume my place on
      the load, and draw in my legs and arms like a turtle. Completely taken up
      with my plans and perils, it never occurred to me that I was one of the
      most uncanny creatures that ever went abroad in the night. Suddenly I
      heard a swift movement beside me, and turned my head. My companion had
      awakened, and was crowding as far away as possible, his mouth and eyes
      wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a great gasp, and, before I could find words to calm him, shouted:
      &ldquo;Land! What's this?&rdquo; and leaped from the wagon. It was a wonder&mdash;the
      swiftness of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be afraid!&rdquo; I called, as I checked the horses. &ldquo;It's I&mdash;Cricket
      Heron. I got away in a potato-sack and came on the load.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment looking up at me, and gasping for breath. &ldquo;Cricket
      Heron!&rdquo; he exclaimed, presently, and stood gazing up at me in silence for
      half a moment, and supporting himself on a front wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, boy,&rdquo; said he, in a voice that betrayed his agitation, &ldquo;excuse me,
      but you'll have to find other company. You've wore me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused half a moment for breath, and went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a sack o' potatoes sets down beside ye an' opens conversation, it's
      a little more than I can stan'.&rdquo; He resumed his seat and took a look at
      me, and added, with a laugh, &ldquo;You'd scare the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few words I told my story, and he seemed to believe and to pity me.
      He put a few queries, and I answered freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better go home an' tell the truth about it,&rdquo; he said, as he hurried
      the horses. &ldquo;The only thing I don't like about you is your runnin' away.
      God hates a coward, an' He don't seem to care if a coward suffers. Take
      that thing off. Be a man; don't be a sack o' potatoes. You'd cheat the man
      that bought ye for two bushels o' potatoes. They're worth more than a
      coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He untied the string above my head, and I took off the sack. The lights of
      the village were just ahead. He drove to a store whose proprietor was
      awaiting him. There he paid me the sum of six dollars for my work, and I
      left him and went to a small inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended the adventure of the potato-sack. It taught me that a man is
      never so good as the thing he tries to be, whether it is a hero or a sack
      of potatoes.

    <p>
      LAY until after midnight groping in the mine of thought which Mr. Baker
      had laid open. It was a new kind of exercise, and, for one thing, after
      digging in my conceit awhile, I found a brain. It was not a large find,
      but there are some, surely, who go through life without as good luck. It
      was the most impudent brain I ever knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a fool and a coward,&rdquo; it seemed to say to me. &ldquo;What are you going
      to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look for employment,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I'm doing, and you're the only one in the world who can give
      it. Try me.&rdquo; And I did&mdash;thought it all over, and began to make rules
      for the regulation of my conduct. Thereafter I would be brave; no more
      skulking for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was up at daybreak with a new tone in my voice. That morning I spent
      half of my money for a new flannel shirt and some fresh underwear. I felt
      very brave and careless when I started for Summerville with the village
      behind me. It was a walk of seven miles, and nothing happened except Sam,
      who had driven over in a buggy and come down the road to meet me. He was
      dressed up, and had a dreamy eye and a red face. &ldquo;What luck?&rdquo; I queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't seen her yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Get in here. I'm so scairt I'm all of a
      tremble. You got through all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the old man said. Thought he'd die laughin' 'bout the potato-sack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cured me of being a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish he could cure me,&rdquo; said Sam Whitemore. &ldquo;I ain't afraid o' man or
      beast, or anything but a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women won't hurt you,&rdquo; I argued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but they can make ye awful 'shamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed very curious&mdash;the timidity of this big, powerful man. I had
      seen him handle a ton of wheat in five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They all look dangerous to me,&rdquo; he added. Then he sighed and exclaimed,
      &ldquo;Heavens to Betsey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't Fannie willing to marry you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks that way, but maybe she's only foolin'.&rdquo; He shook his head
      nervously, and added: &ldquo;If she was you'd see me light out. I wouldn't stop
      runnin' this side o' Californey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be afraid,&rdquo; was my ready counsel. &ldquo;She wants to marry you or she
      wouldn't have asked you to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if inspired with new courage, he drew up the reins and touched his
      horse with the whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll ask her if it kills me,&rdquo; he said, his brow wrinkling with
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke until we entered the little village of Summerville. He left
      me at the hotel, where I was to wait for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin' up to see her,&rdquo; he said, in low, half-whispered tones. &ldquo;I'll ask
      her to take a ride with me. Oh, I forgot! A letter come for you this
      mornin'; here it is. An', say, one o' them men that come last night said
      that he was a friend o' yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I didn't believe him. I guess he was tryin' to fox me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened the letter as he drove away and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Son,&mdash;I believe all you say, and am very sorry for you. It is
      a grief and a wonder to me that you didn't turn back and let him go his
      own way when you saw that he was a law-breaker. You wouldn't have missed
      the watch as much as you miss me and your self-respect. You remember what
      I said to you about taking up with people you don't know. Since you have
      chosen not to follow my counsel. I presume you have found your own better
      than mine. If that is true, I shall need your advice, and will rely upon
      you to guide me in every time of difficulty. You have strong hands and
      have learned how to use them. You have many friends and a mother who will
      do anything she can for you. But we must reap as we sow. You should
      retrace your own steps in the wrong road and find your way back. God help
      you! Come as soon as you can and tell the truth, and be not afraid. Truth
      will beat all the lawyers. If you should be sick let me know, and I will
      come to you. Tell me where to send clothing for your comfort. I send a
      little money and much love.
    </p>
    <p>
      That letter was a godsend. I was inclined to agree with Sam that women can
      make one &ldquo;awful 'shamed.&rdquo; My young manhood really began that day. I put
      the money, which would have paid my fare to Heartsdale, in my stocking,
      and determined not to use it. I would find my own way back to her. .
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour or so later Sam returned with a cheerful look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're goin' to be married,&rdquo; he whispered, as he almost broke my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next week, Monday, an' we're goin' to Niagara Falls. It's a big
      excursion, an' costs only a dollar an' sixty cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Niagara Falls! The great water-hammers!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could go with you,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;we'll have a grand time. But you must go to the
      weddin'&mdash;you'll kind o' steady me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was thrilled by what lay before me, for now I should see the Falls and
      the fleet horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can earn my board, I'll stay where I am until Monday,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm goin' to see the landlord. He's an old
      friend o' mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, within five minutes Sam got a job for me. I was to look after the
      billiard-tables, and to receive my board for my labor until we went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening an elderly man of distinguished appearance sat in the
      billiard-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, my boy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him my name and where I lived, and that I was going to the Falls,
      Monday, and working for my board meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; said he, stroking his white mustache and imperial, &ldquo;so you're
      from the land of Silas Wright?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He asked about certain good people that he had known in my county, and
      then said: &ldquo;This is no kind of work for you to be doing. Pack your grip
      and come home with me. You may share my room, and stay as long as you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, the end of it was that I went home with Colonel Busby&mdash;that
      being his name&mdash;soldier, orator, philosopher. He and his daughter&mdash;a
      girl of about my age&mdash;were alone in the house with one servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jo,&rdquo; said he to the girl, as we entered, &ldquo;this is a high-stepper from St.
      Lawrence County, and a friend of mine. His name is Cricket Heron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave me her hand, and said, laughingly, that her name was
      Josephine. She was tall and slender, and I remember thinking that she had
      almost a woman's look in her dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper the Colonel said he was going over town and would return
      presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter made me feel at home, and had pretty manners, and a sweet,
      girlish way of talking, and that charm of youth which has no suspicion of
      its riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, I think of her mouth&mdash;perfect in its curves and color.
      Out of it came joy and careless words set in wonderful music. What a
      voice! Upon my honor, sometimes it was like a scale played on the flute.
      We all know the music&mdash;that ringing of the golden bowl of youth when
      Pleasure touches it, and know, too, how soon the bowl is broken. She sang
      and played upon the guitar, and talked, and this, above all, I remember:
      she seemed unconscious of herself and of her power over my foolish heart.
      We compared our knowledge of poetry and romance, our aims and ideals, our
      tastes and pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Colonel came not, although the clock had struck eleven. She
      suggested that I might wish to retire. It was a thought of her, and not of
      myself, that led me to rise and say that I was ready. She lighted a candle
      and showed me to my room. I went to bed thinking that, after all, my Mary
      was not her equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour or so later the Colonel's voice awoke me. He was calling my name
      in a loud, imperative tone, and tramping about the house as if in search
      of me. I lay still, not knowing what to do. Soon the Colonel entered my
      room with a candle in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heron, you rascal, get out of this room!&rdquo; said he, loudly. &ldquo;Didn't I say
      you were to sleep with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could answer he had gathered up my shoes and stockings and flung
      them into the hall. He took my clothing under his arm while I got out of
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward, march!&rdquo; he commanded, and I followed through the dusky halls to
      his bedroom in silence. I observed that he walked unsteadily, and I knew
      the nature of his affliction and felt some fear of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heron,&rdquo; said he, with great frankness, &ldquo;I want company&mdash;I need you
      right here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sang loudly, as I helped him to draw his boots:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;''Tis the last rose of summer left blooming alone.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment he rose and seized me by the shoulders and crowded me against
      the wall, by way of demonstrating his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are iron, boy, but I am steel,&rdquo; he said, between his teeth, as he
      lightly thumped my head upon the figured paper. I made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The severe look in his face turned to smiles in half a moment. He showed
      me his wounds&mdash;a saber slash on his head, and a number of scars cut
      by bullets and flying fragments of shell. He asked me to feel his biceps,
      and I did so, not wishing to be impolite. Before I could step aside he had
      my head in chancery, and was making a new demonstration. The candle was
      knocked to the floor, and I struggled with Colonel Busby in the darkness,
      feeling a dreadful uncertainty of his plans. Soon he had pushed me into a
      corner, where I stood clinging to his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhand me, villain!&rdquo; he commanded, and we released each other and I
      relighted the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel took off his tie and collar, and as he did so whispered
      gruffly, and with a playful wagging of his head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How ill that taper burns! Ha! who comes there? Cold drops of sweat hang
      on my trembling flesh. My blood grows chilly, and I freeze with horror.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that it was all a kind of harmless frolic, and soon he proposed that
      we &ldquo;knit up the ravelled sleeve of care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We got into bed, and fortunately the Colonel soon fell asleep. I had
      rather a bad night of it, for he snored and muttered, and was, on the
      whole, an irksome creature. In the morning he said little, and sat with a
      look of sadness. He went into the garden after breakfast, and Jo said to
      me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry my father disturbed you. I didn't think he would do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's nothing,&rdquo; I assured her, bravely. &ldquo;I hope it doesn't worry
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I could see that my words had not relieved her unhappiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to school, and I spent the day writing letters&mdash;one to my
      mother and one to Mr. McCarthy, in both of which I set down much that I
      have tried to tell you. Then I composed a verse and engrossed it with
      great care. For such folly&mdash;praise God&mdash;I had always a keen
      relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that evening the Colonel left us, and I helped the pretty girl with
      her lessons, and we had two more wistful hours, the like of which one
      remembers with thankfulness and a sad smile. Where should I look to match
      them? Surely not in my own life, long as it has been. She sighed when I
      spoke of leaving, and a little tremble in her lips said so much to me&mdash;things
      rich with meaning and mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to help in the kitchen next week,&rdquo; said she, with an air of
      responsibility. &ldquo;Fannie, our cook, is to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name is Comstock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about it&mdash;Sam told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with a look of contempt. &ldquo;He kept her waiting three
      years because he hadn't the courage to propose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I told her of my adventures, and how they led to Sam, and how Sam had
      straightway led me to her, or, at least, so near that we could not help
      meeting. I told her of our life at Baker's, but said not a word of the
      letter&mdash;that seemed to me a sacred confidence. However, I did tell of
      Sam's fear when he reached Summerville. She thought it very foolish of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that would be the best part of it&mdash;asking her to
      marry him and telling about his love,&rdquo; said she, turning serious and
      feeling her beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a man would you prefer?&rdquo; I bravely inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; she said, leaning her chin upon her hands in a thoughtful
      and pretty pose. &ldquo;Of course, he must be good, and he really <i>must</i> be
      handsome and tall and strong and brave, and I want him to be a great man;
      and I am studying very, very hard so that I can help him to be great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat in silence for a little time, full of sad thoughts. I was neither
      handsome nor tall nor brave, but sometimes I had thought myself
      exceedingly good. As to becoming great, that was another respect in which
      I felt strong and confident. .
    </p>
    <p>
      I was undersized&mdash;yes, a little undersized. I would grow some,
      however&mdash;possibly to six feet; who could tell? But&mdash;my face&mdash;there
      was no dodging that. It was plain, very plain, I could see that myself,
      and my hair did not curl and was too light, and my beard was not yet born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo interrupted my thoughts. She began to clap her hands in a sudden
      outburst of enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a grand idea!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We'll give Fannie a little wedding here
      if father will let us. I think it would be great fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour or so we sat, making plans for the wedding. Before going
      to bed, in the Colonel's room, I gave her my horruck&mdash;an act of great
      generosity. I promised to tell her all about it if she could solve the
      riddle, and she said that she would try.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to bed, and the Colonel returned shortly, very bad. I had drawn his
      boots and remarked that he looked weary, when suddenly he rose and picked
      up a foil and began to thrust and parry with a hand raised behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you insult me, sir!&rdquo; he hissed, as he danced on tiptoes in the
      attitude of a fencer, and drove me across the room. He stopped suddenly,
      his point on the floor, in a haughty pose, and demanded, &ldquo;Will you have a
      blade, sir, and a bout with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know how to fence,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;then you are forgiven,&rdquo; said he, with a loving smile and a
      jaunty swing of his head. &ldquo;But, mind you&mdash;mind you, I cannot brook an
      insult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the light was extinguished he sent his voice roaring through the
      still house in two lines of <i>The Last Rose of Summer</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got into bed, and as soon as I could decently do it I feigned sleep, to
      avoid conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay thinking for hours after the Colonel had gone to sleep&mdash;hours,
      indeed, of fearful expectation. It was awful to room with a man like
      Colonel Busby, but, after all, it was a good schooling in bravery, and the
      time had come when I must be brave. I longed for perils, and for even a
      wound or two. If there should be a war I would enlist, if possible, and
      show her how brave I could be. Perhaps, if I became very brave and good
      and strong and great, she would forgive my lack of size and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of these reflections my companion lay groaning with
      nightmare, and this further thought came to me that, hard as it was to be
      his friend, it would be still more terrible to be Colonel Busby himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To such a hopeful state of mind my last adventure had brought me.

    <p>
      O went the days and nights with us there in the home of Colonel Busby, and
      I am nearly through with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning Jo said to me: &ldquo;I'm sorry that father behaved so last night.
      It's dreadful. Did he hurt you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; was my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as brave as you can be,&rdquo; she went on, with a look of shame and
      sorrow. &ldquo;It worries me terribly. Oh, dear! I wouldn't marry a man who
      drinks for all the money in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd need it to repair the furniture,&rdquo; I suggested, full of a great joy
      that she thought me brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes filled with tears, and I remember well the tender dignity with
      which I took her hand and tried to comfort her. It was a pretty picture,
      upon my word&mdash;the boy and the maiden, and both so clean-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, now, as to Sam and the wedding. We invited a number of Fannie's
      friends, who were servants in the neighborhood, and made a monster cake
      and some ice-cream. Sam arrived early, red and uncomfortable, and looking
      very new in a fresh suit of clothes. His voice, even, was afraid to show
      itself, as one might say. He held it down near a whisper and had a
      watchful eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo and a few of her school-girl friends had decorated the parlor, and
      spread a table in the dining-room with refreshments. Now they stood
      looking at Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes filled with alarm as we laid our plans before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't broke to this kind o' thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an' I'm scairt clear
      through. Maybe it could be put off until I'm nerved up a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said Jo, as she locked the door and faced about with a saucy
      look in her eyes. &ldquo;You've simply got to be married at ten o'clock. You
      might as well make up your mind to it first as last. You've kept Fannie
      waiting for three years, and now you're going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Sam shook his head and smiled, and looked rather foolish and unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't be afraid,&rdquo; Jo went on. &ldquo;We're not going to hurt you. We're
      just going to marry you, and I should think you'd be very happy. Fannie is
      a good girl, and a sweet-look-, ing girl, too, and she'll be a help to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was as good as a play to hear her talk to him. Sam had an anxious look,
      and was, in a way, like one condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like,&rdquo; said he, with just a little emphasis on the like&mdash;&ldquo;I'd
      like to go over to the village a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, but there isn't time,&rdquo; Jo answered. She was gentle but firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm no coward,&rdquo; he said, in a voice that trembled a little, &ldquo;but&mdash;I
      ain't used to women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; said Jo, with just a touch of contempt for him. &ldquo;You've got
      to get used to them, and I'll give you the first lesson. Stand where you
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fannie, a comely, red-cheeked girl of about his age, had entered the room.
      Jo took her arm and led her up to Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now give him a good kiss,&rdquo; the little wretch commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fannie gave him a kiss, but he stood unmoved save that his face grew
      redder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's not fair to take a kiss without returning it. That's cheating,&rdquo;
       Jo protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her, but with such a sober countenance! It suggested
      retaliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brave Sam!&mdash;you're learning,&rdquo; Jo said to him. She put her pretty
      hand in his, and added, soothingly: &ldquo;Be brave, Sam; be brave and cheer up;
      nobody will hurt you. When the minister comes you will stand here, and
      Fannie will stand beside you&mdash;like that. Please keep your hands down
      at your side&mdash;so&mdash;and remember you must pay attention to the
      minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor, old, good-hearted Sam! It was like bitting a horse, and he needed
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he played his part rather poorly, but the wedding was successful in
      its main purpose, and Sam hurried away to bring his horse and buggy. He
      ran as he left the door-yard, like one escaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo beckoned to me, and I went with her into the sitting-room, where for a
      moment we stood alone. How short it was, and yet how long it has been&mdash;that
      little moment!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I kiss you once?&rdquo; I asked, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply, but she let me kiss her. Dear girl! We were so young
      and innocent, and all these years were ahead of us, and&mdash;excuse me&mdash;I
      must change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excursion train that was to take us to the Falls left our depot at one
      o'clock. We were among the first who got aboard, and the cars filled
      rapidly with men and women and crying babies and boys and girls. Ephraim
      Baker and his wife had a seat near us. Venders passed up and down the
      aisle with papers, lemonade, &ldquo;popcorn just about salt enough,&rdquo; apples, and
      a curious, horn-shaped fruit called bananas, the &ldquo;peth&rdquo; of which was
      declared to be &ldquo;very tasty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We reached Syracuse in the evening, and changed to the night express bound
      for Buffalo. An attraction of the trip, which had been much advertised,
      was a chance to see one of the new sleeping-cars on the Central, and an
      engine burning coal instead of wood. About eight o'clock, while we were
      waiting on a side-track, the conductor invited us to pass, through the
      train and take a look at the new sleeping-car. We filed slowly through it&mdash;a
      car glowing with varnish and highly decorated panels, and divided into
      four sections by curtains of heavy cloth. Each section had a lower,
      middle, and upper berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late at night, as I sat half asleep leaning on Sam's glazed satchel, a man
      entered our car, picked up the satchel, and set it in the aisle and took
      the seat beside me. In a moment the conductor came along calling
      &ldquo;tickets.&rdquo; The man in my seat showed a pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the name?&rdquo; the conductor queried, as he took the card and held it
      in the glow of his lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George M. Pullman,&rdquo; said the man at my side. &ldquo;I stayed in the
      sleeping-car as long as I could stand it, and made my escape. You might as
      well try to sleep in the middle of Broadway. The berths rattle, and I was
      bumped around until I thought a horse and wagon were running over me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon after that he began drawing a diagram on a large envelope with a
      lead-pencil, and as he sat beside me I saw the beginning of a new chapter
      in railroad history.
    </p>
    <p>
      From every point of the compass, that night, people were on their way to
      the Falls. Next morning they would see wonderful things&mdash;athletic
      contests, a balloon ascension, and a man walking across the chasm on a
      rope. I had longed to see the &ldquo;big water-hammers&rdquo; and the fleet horses. I
      thought chiefly of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived safely, and Sam led his wife by the hand through noisy crowds,
      and warned me to keep near. We travelled a long time trying to find
      shelter within our means. We found a place at last, although at a price
      that made us thoughtful. I was a little worried for myself, there in the
      cold, indifferent crowds, with so little in my pocket. I felt so very
      small that day, and feared there was no hope for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, when the morning had come and I stood gazing at the water-hammers
      and the flying horses below, and wondering how men were going to tame and
      control them, who should come and whack me on the shoulder but Bony
      Squares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello&mdash;old boy!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;here's that two dollars I borrowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was almost a shock to me&mdash;his unexpected honesty and my
      good-fortune. After all, he could not be so bad as I had thought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broke and lookin' for a job, I suppose?&rdquo; he queried, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've only a little money, and don't know yet what I'm going to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like to earn fifty dollars to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fifty dollars! It was a great sum! I could go home with it and possibly
      pay my fine, if that were necessary. But how so much in a day if it were
      honest money?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will take nerve,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I guess you're not brave enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're wrong there. I'm brave enough for any work&mdash;if it's honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's as honest as my aunt Maria,&rdquo; he assured me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew that venerable lady, and on the score of honor it seemed rather
      promising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's as safe as standing here on the sidewalk, but, old boy, it will take
      some nerve,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It will take more nerve than I've got, and I'm
      no squab at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked, burning with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you've heard of the chap who's going to walk a rope across the
      rapids? It will be way up in the air. You can just see it now, down the
      river there, hanging between the cliffs. Looks like a spider's thread&mdash;but,
      say, it weighs a ton. I've been helping 'em hang it. The old man wants to
      carry some light, nervy chap on his shoulders when he makes the trip.
      There's only one that's used to the game, and he's on a spree, and they're
      stuck&mdash;can't find a fellow game enough for the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is hard to separate a boy from his folly&mdash;not all the schools in
      the world can help much; and for a long time it is like a sword hanging
      over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      I jumped at the offer, for had I not determined for her sake to fear no
      peril?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; said Bony. &ldquo;He'll want to try you, and there's no time to
      lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went to Sam and Fannie, and promised to see them at the inn at six.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for scamps, boy,&rdquo; Sam whispered. &ldquo;Keep your eye peeled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured him that I would do so, and hurried down the high shore with
      Bony.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder, sometimes, that I let myself go on. Well, there is something
      deep in it which I do not profess to understand. The spirit of the time
      was in me, and I was like ten thousand others. Men loved the perils of
      adventure those days. No speculation was too reckless for them, no hazard
      too fearful, no enterprise too difficult. The risks of the desert and the
      plains and the battle-field had schooled us for that kind of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I had learned one thing, at least, since the last lesson&mdash;that
      a good heart may be in a rough body. Remember&mdash;you children of luxury&mdash;that
      some rather hard-handed people have been my friends.

    <p>
      E made our way through crowds of people near the end of the great rope.
      Bony shouted like one in authority, and they let us pass. We found the
      rope-walker in a small tent near the edge of the precipice. He was a big,
      brawny Frenchman, who reminded me of the picture of Goliath confronted by
      David in my bedchamber at home. He surveyed me from head to foot while
      Bony called some one aside&mdash;it was a man I became acquainted with in
      due time&mdash;and addressed him confidentially. Looking out, I could see
      the long rope dipping low in the chasm from the cliff's edge and ascending
      to the farther shore; I could hear the roar of the rapids far below us,
      and felt a little tremor inside of me. Really, now that I had a chance to
      make her and all the world wonder at me, I thought of backing out.
      However, I was not brave enough for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great man came presently, and took hold of my arms and lifted me as if
      I had been a sack of potatoes. It seemed revolting, I remember, to be so
      handled, for, clearly, he had no respect for me, and with good reason. He
      said that he would try me when the rope was ready, and did, and said I
      would do. Bony and I went outside the tent and saw the great rope being
      tightened with horse and capstan. It lay almost level, by-and-by, in a
      long, sweeping curve that could have gone to the moon, I fancy, if its
      circle had been completed. The Frenchman came out of his tent presently,
      in tights and shoulder-braces of new leather, upon which two loops or
      handles had been fastened, one over each shoulder. He carefully examined
      the capstan and the pawls beneath it. He spoke a swift word or two in
      French, whereupon a young man, who acted as interpreter, requested me to
      remove my boots, and I did so. Then the performer stepped in front of me,
      and, reaching backward over his body, took my hands in his. I jumped to
      his back and caught the loops over my wrists and clung to the leathern
      braces, while he carefully placed my feet on his hips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big Frenchman took a few paces and began to chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loosen up a little,&rdquo; said the interpreter. &ldquo;Don't stand so stiff. There,
      that's better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An attendant brought the balancing-rod, and the performer took it and
      approached the end of the rope. I could now look down far into the abyss
      and felt my heart failing me. But I thought of Jo, and imagined that she
      was there, and said to myself that I would rather die than be a coward.
      Before I knew it he was on the slant of the rope and slowly descending,
      and so silently it seemed as if he were walking the soft air. I heard a
      murmur start suddenly, and go up and down the shore near us. The roar of
      the waters burst upon me from below. I knew that there was plenty of air
      beneath us, but was not brave enough to look down through that long, long
      drop to the foamy water-floor of the chasm. I kept my eyes on the tree-top
      at the edge of the farther cliff. I heard a voice call to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head and answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The performer stopped and began to sway a little, his rod moving up and
      down. I tightened my grip and breathed faster. I remember well the play of
      his muscles under me. I could feel a change in their action&mdash;he was
      going backward, but very slowly. The roar of the water was diminishing,
      and stopped as suddenly as it began. We were back on the earth again, and
      I was very glad and a little shaky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the Frenchman said that I would do, and half a dozen men shook my
      hand and made me proud with their compliments. The interpreter told me
      that we would &ldquo;cross the bridge&rdquo; at three, and that I should wait there
      and have my dinner with them. The big Frenchman put on his clothes and
      drove away in a carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those hours of waiting were a great trial to me. I paced up and down
      before the tent, and Bony tried to talk to me, but I said little and heard
      less. I remember his telling in a whisper that they would not take a boy
      so young without the consent of his parents, and that he had told them
      that he was my father. I assured him, with dignity, that I would not lie
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just say nothing. I'll do all the lying that's necessary,&rdquo; said Bony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they ask me I shall tell the truth,&rdquo; I affirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better not put me in a hole when I'm trying to do you a favor,&rdquo;
       Bony pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer, but somehow his words had cheapened the enterprise, of
      which I had had no high opinion since the performer had lifted me as if I
      were a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The edges of the cliffs began to turn black with people, and I could hear
      the sound of many voices. Suddenly those near us began cheering. The great
      Frenchman had returned. It was about three o'clock. He came straight to
      me, and shook my hand, and said in French, &ldquo;<i>Courage!</i>&rdquo; and added
      something which I could not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be as safe as you are here,&rdquo; said the interpreter. &ldquo;Don't jump if
      he sways a little, and don't look down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman hurried to his tent. It was time to &ldquo;cross the bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They gave me a pair of white stockings with soles of corrugated rubber,
      and I drew them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes dragged while the Frenchman was dressing. He came out in pink
      tights, and the crowd, pressing on the ropes around us, began to cheer. He
      tried his pole, and then came straight to me. That was a bad moment, and I
      felt like running for my life, but&mdash;no&mdash;I could not do so now.
      The interpreter asked me to remove my coat and put on a close-fitting cap
      in place of the hat I wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a second we were on the rope, and he began reaching for his balance. He
      felt his way slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people were cheering and waving their handkerchiefs. The bands ceased
      playing. He quickened his pace, and went on with a steady stride. A roar
      of excitement followed the cheering, and then a hush fell on the crowds.
      For half a moment I could hear only the breathing of the performer and my
      own heart-beat. Then I heard the snort of the &ldquo;white horses&rdquo; far below me.
      Suddenly the shrill, hysterical cry of a woman rose out of the silence.
      Right after that I could hear the groans of men behind us, and wild peals
      of laughter that echoed through the deep chasm and had a weird note in
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were those for whom the sight of our peril was as a nightmare.
      Phrases of prayer came out to my ears&mdash;&ldquo;God have mercy on them,&rdquo; and
      the like. Little children called to us. There were two or three men who
      groaned at every step of the walker, as if they felt the strain of his
      muscles. It was an old Roman spectacle, and at no other time in the
      nineteenth century would it have been possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had kept my eyes on the tree-top, and now I could see the lift of the
      rope before me; I could hear it creak as it bent beneath us. For an
      instant I let my glance fall. Down, down it went like a plummet sounding
      the depths below. I shut my eyes, but my thoughts went plunging downward.
      I was like a man with his hands full of eggs&mdash;one falls, and then
      they all begin to slip away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I looked again the cliffs were reeling before us. I had to stop them,
      single-handed, and I can tell you it was a task. With a mighty effort I
      shoved them back into place again and held them down&mdash;at least, that
      is the way I thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were down in the hollow of the rope, about half-way across the chasm,
      and were swinging a little in a wind current. The Frenchman slowed his
      pace, and I could feel the changing tension of his muscles. He struck the
      rope with one foot and then the other&mdash;a sort of hammer blow. It
      checked the swing, and for half a second he seemed to cling with his feet.
      He took three quick steps, and settled into an even pace again. I thought
      of letting go, for the relief of it. But this notion came to me, and I
      laugh when I think of its oddity: if I should let go I should lose the
      fifty dollars, which would buy something fine for my mother. And I clung
      so that my hands ached. I watched a swallow, and ceased to think of
      myself. That little bird may have saved my life, for me and for you. He
      coasted through the sunlit air almost to the point of my nose, checked
      himself with a giggle of surprise, and wound us in loops of song. Somehow
      it heartened me to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rope grew steeper. Now it seemed an impossible journey there ahead of
      us. But he went on with a steady stride, and the hempen hill bent inward
      as he put his feet upon it. With joy I could see my tree-top coming
      nearer, but every step I had to look up a little farther to see it.
      Suddenly the rope began to swing again&mdash;I do not know why. It has
      been said that some reckless fellow had wilfully pulled a guy-rope. The
      whole side of the cliff began to rock as before. The strands of muscle
      under me tightened quickly. The performer slowed his pace, and stopped for
      half a second. The ends of his pole went up and down like a teeter-board.
      Again his feet struck the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Courage!</i>&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took two or three quick steps and stopped again. He had checked the
      swing of the rope, and now resumed his progress up the steep hill. He
      climbed slowly near the end of it, and a mighty cheer ran up and down the
      edge of the cliffs when he sprang ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      I jumped from his back, and saw, when he shook my hand, that his own
      trembled a bit and that he was breathing heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put on a suit of clothes and beckoned me to a carriage that stood near.
      I took a seat beside him, and went to his inn. The interpreter met us
      there, and had my bouts, coat, and hat with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur wishes me to thank you, and say that we have paid your father,&rdquo;
       he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the man who came with you. Is he not your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and he has taken my money and gone with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So bitter was my disappointment that I sat down upon the floor, and
      covered my face and wept. Then there was a great chattering in French, and
      the performer came and gave me a pat of sympathy on my shoulder and a
      ten-dollar bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowd of curious people followed me on my way to my inn&mdash;mostly
      boys of about my own age and younger. They felt of my garments, and ran
      before me, staring into my face. Grievous and heavy was my sense of
      distinction. It covered me with shame. There was something wrong about my
      bravery.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the inn I found Sam and his bride and Ephraim Baker. Somehow they had
      heard of my part in the rope-walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did that crowd of boys follow you?&rdquo; Sam inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can't see the biggest fool in America <i>every day</i>,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I suddenly got a strong desire to move on. I was a bit wiser when I
      started for Graham's hotel in Buffalo, where Mr. McCarthy was to meet me.
      Ephraim Baker had called me a fool, but I knew better than that. I had
      sense enough now, at least, to understand the difference between courage
      and folly. It is about the last lesson of boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      That narrow, bending path of hemp had been for me a bridge between the
      cliffs of youth and young manhood, of recklessness and prudence. The
      crossing is ever full of peril, and there is always some one to pull the
      rope and increase our difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked Sam and his bride to say nothing of my adventure in Summerville,
      and bade them goodbye at the depot, and went on my way to a new school of
      experience.

    <p>
      RAHAM'S hotel was near the depot, as I asked my way of an officer, and he
      went with me. At the desk I inquired timidly for my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. James Henry McCarthy is here,&rdquo; the clerk answered, with a smile. &ldquo;He
      is making the homes of this city bright and beautiful, Wish to see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called a colored youth, and sent word to Mr. McCarthy. The colored
      youth returned presently, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. McCarthy says, 'Please ask the gentleman to send up his card.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wrote my name on a card, and in a few minutes presented myself at Mr.
      McCarthy's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pleased to see you,&rdquo; said he, with dignity. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was well dressed in new clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo; he asked, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; was my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That suit cost me twenty-one dollars,&rdquo; he remarked, with a glance at
      himself. &ldquo;Feel of the cloth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did as he bade me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't this a grand room?&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I guess you must have thought that
      I was getting along in the world when you were asked to send up your card
      to Mr. McCarthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, and rattled his change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have a cigar?&rdquo; he asked, removing two from his waistcoat-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I carry them for the sake of appearances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grand,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have six men at work for me, and have started a
      little factory at home. My sister makes Sal, and the agents buy it from
      us, and so we have no bother. We ship it in crates, like a lot of eggs,
      and each ball is neatly wrapped and all ready for the customer. I am also
      beginning the manufacture of soap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I expressed my delight over his good-fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you getting along?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him the story of my failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the trouble,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy. &ldquo;A green hand is apt to slip
      down making the goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;'There's many a fall

      'Twixt the powder and ball,'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      as ye might say. That's why I started the factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paid my debt to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to take out another line of goods?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I'm going home,&rdquo; was my answer. &ldquo;I'll write to you if I decide to try
      it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you need this money to get home with,&rdquo; he suggested, in a careless
      and opulent manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have enough,&rdquo; was my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, an' le' 's have a little visit,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I like you, an'
      by-an'-by I'll take you out an' show you the sights. I want to treat you
      as one gentleman would treat another. Have you noticed that I don't say
      'ain't' for 'isn't' or 'them' for 'those' any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I notice that you speak very properly,&rdquo; I assured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got a grammar, and have begun to study it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My tea-pot is
      all made, as ye might say, an' I have begun to put a polish on it. Let me
      show ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and put on his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, suppose I've rung the bell an' Mrs. Smith opens the door. I bow so,
      and say: 'Good-morning, madam,' or 'Good-afternoon, madam. Would you like
      to engage a servant who will work for you at half a cent a day and board
      herself? I have one of the name of Sal. Sal cleans woodwork, silver, and
      all kinds of metal, and never complains.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't talk as much as I used to. Some way it don't sound honest, and I
      find out that gentlemen are not apt to be gabby. I try to please and show
      that I want to earn an honest living, and I get along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, the children like me because I like them, and everybody is glad
      to see me when I come around. The other day a woman asked me to mind her
      children while she went of an errand. It would have tickled you to see how
      they piled on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat in a chair and laughed, and put his wooden leg on the bed, and
      pulled a grip and two pillows into his lap, and flung the bolster over his
      leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that's about the way I looked,&rdquo; he went on, with a laugh. &ldquo;I made
      faces for 'em and told 'em how I lost my leg, and we had a grand time of
      it. It's the same way with grownup folks. If you want them to like you,
      you've got to like them. A gentleman never speaks badly of any one; that's
      another thing I've learnt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a gentleman, then,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one man about whom I couldn't say anything mean enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you owe him a thrashing, wait until you can pay him off proper.
      You can't do it with your tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew then that James Henry McCarthy, crude as he was, had got a little
      ahead of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I'm working on my gentleman every day,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I'll have
      him in decent shape by-an'-by. I read a good deal, because every gentleman
      reads, and I'm beginning to enjoy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you'd make me a visit; I want you to meet my mother,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You must come from a very respectable
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can tell by your looks and your way of talking,&rdquo; he remarked.
      &ldquo;You've been well brought up&mdash;a ready-made gentleman, as ye might
      say. It's grand to have all that done for ye. I wasn't so lucky. But I'm
      made upon honor&mdash;hand-sewed and stitched and double-soled. I ought to
      wear well. You could rely on me to behave myself if you took me into your
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a colored boy came to the door and said: &ldquo;There's a man
      down-stairs who wants to see Mr. McCarthy, and he won't give me a card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show the gentleman up,&rdquo; said my friend, as if accustomed to many callers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently in walked the Pearl of great price with the dog, Mr. Barker. I
      was overjoyed to see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me feel of you,&rdquo; he said, as he took my hand. &ldquo;Now don't be scairt
      an' jump out o' the window. Just agree to stay with me for a minute. I'll
      agree not to kill you. I&mdash;I couldn't get even with you in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, le' 's have the minutes of the previous meetin',&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be remembered that H. M. Pearl, Esq., had lived through years of
      oratory and public assemblage, and that his thoughts ran more or less in
      their cant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meeting will now come to order, and Mr. Barker will take the floor,&rdquo;
       said the Pearl of great price.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog came and stood on his hind feet, facing his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will recall,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl, addressing the animal, &ldquo;that I once
      spoke to you on the subject of bad company. Is the same true to-day or
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog gave a loud bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl; &ldquo;of course it is true! Therefore, Mr.
      Barker, please bear in mind that there is nothing that makes so much
      trouble as bad company. It will bring your black hairs in sorrow to the
      grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog was excused, and the Pearl turned to me and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went into the barn at Baker's, an' I'll swear ye didn't come out of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was he, then, who had followed me. My heart began to warm with delight,
      and that singular masquerade of mine came back to me, and I went through
      it all for them. So great was the amusement of Mr. Pearl that he flirted
      his feet in the air and laughed, while Mr. McCarthy whacked his wooden leg
      with the stove poker, and shook his head, and gave an odd cackle. Alas! I
      cannot tell it now as I did then, for those days I had the heart of youth
      in me and a voice for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've chased you for three weeks,&rdquo; said the Pearl. &ldquo;You're like a flea on
      the body o' the United States. I had a talk with a friend o' your mother,
      an' set out to bring you back. Made a birch-bark canoe, an' run her down
      to the St. Lawrence an' up to the end o' the lake. Heard from your mother
      at Sackett's; she said you were at Baker's and would meet Mr. McCarthy
      here. You jumped from Baker's to somewhere, an' then to the Falls, an'
      then here, an' I've been a jump behind you all the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose, dumb with surprise, and Mr. Pearl continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got back to Mill Pond a day or two after you an' Bony lit out. A good
      deal was bein' said, an' I had to lick a man for sayin' a part of it,
      which the said language wasn't calculated to improve your reputation. Oh,
      I tell ye, things have warmed up an' transpired since you went away! I
      says to 'em that you wasn't any Dan'l Webster, an' that Bony had drawed
      you into his game. I know you didn't have no more idea o' wrong-doin' than
      a pickerel has of a vest-pocket. One day I promised to go down to the big
      river an' see if I could pick ye up. So here I am, an' the next thing in
      the order of exercises will be new business. We've got to convey ourselves
      out o' here immediately, if not sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; I said, rising and putting on my hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to move, an' conversation won't carry us. To get down to plain
      language, have you any money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight dollars and forty-three cents,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The report is accepted,&rdquo; Mr. Pearl went on. &ldquo;It is as good as a million
      dollars. We'll go down to the lake an' take a steamer, get off at
      Sackett's, walk a few miles, an' proceed with our own steam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was arranged, with the hearty concurrence of H. M. Pearl, Esq., that
      Mr. McCarthy should go with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will give me a rest, and I can put some agents at work in your part of
      the country,&rdquo; said the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set out together, and got to Sackett's Harbor next day. It was a long
      walk to the beach at Anderson's, where the big canoe of my friend was
      lying. He had left a small tent and two horse-blankets in a house near by.
      Mr. McCarthy bought a basket of provisions at a store, and soon after noon
      of the second day of our journey we were all aboard and headed down the
      river, Mr. Pearl in the stern seat and I in the bow. We two had paddles,
      while Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
      McCarthy sat amidships near the dog, pushing further into the sea of
      knowledge with his grammar and dictionary. We went on with a steady
      stroke, and a light breeze behind us. It was a cloudless day, and the
      cool, crystal floor of the river chasm tempered the heat of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in pursuit of history,&rdquo; Mr. McCarthy remarked soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you get acquainted with history, by-an'-by history is apt to get
      acquainted with you,&rdquo; Mr. Pearl remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have here a pack of white cards,&rdquo; Mr. McCarthy went on. &ldquo;Every one
      contains a fact. I'll read a few of them to show you what I mean. Number
      one says, 'Columbus discovered America, 1492 '; number two says, 'The
      French settled at Quebec in 1608'; number three says, 'The Spanish settled
      at St. Augustine in 1565,' and so on. Here's a hundred cards and a hundred
      facts. First, I put 'em all in one coat-pocket. Every day I take out a
      card and learn what's on it, and put it into another pocket, and keep the
      pack moving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got it down that H. M. Pearl, Esquire, was born at Machias,
      Maine, in 1817?&rdquo; was a query that came from' the stem seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Hildreth says that all history is necessarily incomplete,&rdquo; Mr.
      McCarthy answered, with a laugh. &ldquo;I like that word <i>incomplete</i>. It
      has a good sound to it. I've got my book full of new words. Say, what's a
      horruck? It ain't in my dictionary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I explained the term, which he had overheard in Pearl's talk at Graham's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The islands were now thick around us, and we landed in a little cove on
      one of them, and went up under the shade of the trees for a bite of
      luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's power for ye,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl, with a glance at the river
      sweeping by us. &ldquo;Lord! she's like a belt off the world's engine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had begun to see the power in the man Pearl himself, young as I was. It
      is clear to me now: the genius of the Republic, soon to express itself in
      dauntless enterprise, in prodigious and unheard-of enginery, had begun to
      stir in him; the imagination that builds and discovers, the humor that
      accepts failure without discouragement, the energy which may not be
      overcome were all in this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had capital,&rdquo; Mr. Pearl added, presently, &ldquo;I'd show ye some actions
      which speak louder than words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do with it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here's the river,&rdquo; he said, mapping it on a stretch of sand with
      his finger. &ldquo;Here's the falls at your house. Here's the town o'
      Heartsdale, about half a mile up the river&mdash;shops an' mills an'
      stores an' houses an' two thousand people, all about as slow as West Injy
      molasses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at us, and took another bite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What they need is power,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;That's what 'll put the zip into a
      town. It 'll wake up the people, an' shake 'em off the cracker-barrels an'
      tumble 'em out o' the rockin'-chairs. It 'll set a pace for 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began to wonder what rude miracle he proposed for the dreaming village
      of Heartsdale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was located wrong,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;but there it is, an' I know how to
      shove some power into it&mdash;power enough to put everything on the
      jump.&rdquo; He turned to Mr. McCarthy, and added: &ldquo;Make a note in your history
      that H. M. Pearl, Esquire, said it, an' that a full account of his actions
      will appear in a later volume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked him how he proposed to do this wonderful thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, wherefore, and, also, why,&rdquo; he said, as he took another bite of
      cheese. &ldquo;Well, ye know where the river jumps over the rocks an' stands up
      like a man thirty feet tall, there by your house? That's where I'll
      perform my actions&mdash;right there.&rdquo; He drew a line in the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a stream o' water thirty feet wide an' a foot an' a half thick.
      There's a horse-power in every square foot of it. I'll take off, say,
      one-quarter o' the fall an' head her into an iron pipe an' let her jump
      down. She strikes like a triphammer, dropping thirty feet in a big,
      cast-iron cylinder. There are holes around the bottom of it. The water
      squirts through 'em with power enough to kick a man's leg off. Now, I'll
      put a wheel there at the bottom, with a big steel rim that has buckets on
      it like the slats in a windmill. Well, out come the jets o' water an' give
      them buckets a cuff that sets the wheel goin'. A shaft on this wheel moves
      the dynamo, an' there you have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Mr. McCarthy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Lectricity,&rdquo; was the prompt answer of the Pearl. &ldquo;Don't you know how
      it's made? Nor I, neither, but I guess I can come as nigh tellin' as any
      one. Here's a stationary wheel out by the end o' the shaft with some short
      bars of iron fastened to the rim of it, an' each bar is wound with a coil
      o' wire. Now, when ye send a current through the coil, that bar o' iron
      gets alive. It will take hold o' any other piece o' iron an' hang on like
      a bulldog. Folk call it a magnet, an' it's some like a boy&mdash;never
      gives any reason for his conduct which nobody understands. It just takes
      hold, an' that's all there is about it. Now, there's another wheel that
      moves with the shaft an' has the same number o' bar ends on it, all made
      o' soft iron but not wrapped with wire. Set these wheels parallel an'
      close, so the bar ends are not more 'n a quarter of an inch apart. The
      magnets begin to pull. The power in 'em jumps over that quarter-inch o'
      open space an' takes hold o' the soft iron. You have to put an awful power
      on the shaft to stir the one wheel on account o' the cling o' the magnets.
      It's like pullin' a cat out of a hole backwards. The power begins to spit
      an' make actions. When you move the wheel an' break the hold o' the
      magnets the power begins to travel an' chases 'round the rim. It opens the
      gate o' the great reservoir an' out comes a stream, an' it's 'lectricity.
      Nobody knows why nor wherefore, an' the magnets keep to work an' say
      nothin'. It's like churnin' cream till ye get butter. Ye break the pull o'
      the magnets an' set it whirlin' in a kind of a current, an' you get a
      power that zips off on a wire at the rate of a hundred and eighty thousand
      miles in a second. That's 'lectricity. It's rather fractious an' fond o'
      travel. But ye can coop it up in the wheels an' steer it where ye like. Ye
      can pen it in with glass an' rubber an' other things just as easy as ye
      can hold water with a tin pail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hold it in popper sections, fastened to both wheels, sweep it up with
      a brush, an' send it off on a wire. I've got a scheme for takin' it from
      the other end o' the wire in large or small quantities to suit the
      purchaser, an' I believe that I can move all the wheels in Heartsdale, an'
      a good many more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I get along in business maybe I can furnish the capital one o' these
      days,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll begin to make history,&rdquo; said the Pearl of great price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCarthy looked thoughtful. The idea of making history brightened his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see what can be done,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again we took our places in the canoe, and it seemed to spring away with
      the current.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll ride the belt,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl. &ldquo;We ought to make ten miles between
      now an' sundown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breeze left us, and the river slackened its pace in a gentler mood.
      Reeds lined its margin with soft shadows into which, often, bunches of
      blue iris flung their color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy, presently, &ldquo;I'm in need of advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Touchin' what subject?&rdquo; Mr. Pearl inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mind is set on matrimony,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell it to get up an' move on,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in love?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear that I am,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy, with his accustomed frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All depends on the other party,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a beautiful girl by the name o' Betsey Fame,&rdquo; the boy answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better be Miss Fame than Misfortune,&rdquo; said the Pearl of great price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My trouble is all on account of this wooden leg,&rdquo; Mr. McCarthy explained.
      &ldquo;I saved her mother's life in a runaway an' got my ankle smashed. She took
      care o' me when I was laid up, and told me to study an' improve my mind
      and be a gentleman. I fell in love with her, and I'm getting along. But my
      gentleman has begun to crush the life out o' Pegleg McCarthy. He's killed
      my best hope, for he won't let me ask her to marry me. She's a wonderful
      nice girl, and belongs to a good family. But here's my wooden leg, and it
      comes o' my tryin' to save her mother. She might think she had ought to
      accept me whether she cares for me or not. She's just that kind of a girl.
      Do you think it's fair for me to ask her? I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pearl and I rested the paddles. Our playful spirit had gone out of us in a
      jiffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the great horn spoon!&rdquo; Pearl exclaimed. &ldquo;Me being a gentleman, what
      can I do?&rdquo; Mr. McCarthy inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, first you go to New York an' get yourself a decent leg, if you can
      afford it,&rdquo; said the Pearl of great price. &ldquo;There's a man by the name o'
      Marks made a leg for a friend o' mine. He wears a shoe an' walks as well
      as ever. Ye wouldn't know that he had a wooden leg. It's a case o' wood
      an' wouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a good idea,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy. &ldquo;Then you can tell her that
      you're really better off than you was before the accident&mdash;that
      you've only half the liability to pains in the feet. Go to work an' pile
      up some money, an' show her that nobody has any license to be sorry for
      you. Maybe you'll see your chance by-an'-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that I'm going to be a rich man,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy. &ldquo;I kind o'
      feel it in my bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bones are beginnin' to talk to me,&rdquo; said the Pearl, as he moved in his
      seat a little. &ldquo;We must begin to look for a camping-place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun had gone down, and glowing bars of cloud were drifting over the
      west. Their reflection made a long, golden raft in the ripples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raft seemed to break as I was looking, and its timber floated far and
      wide into dusky coves and marshes, and some of it went leaping through
      rapids half a mile below. As we rode along in the still twilight, Mr.
      Pearl sang an old ballad in a voice of remarkable power and sweetness.
      Well, the river and the shadows and the sky sang with him, as I am well
      aware, but no music ever got so deep in me as that did.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got out on a pebble beach. There were grassy shores, close-cropped by
      cattle, near us, and a hard-wood grove. The Pearl began to put up his
      tent, while we gathered a bit of wood for a fire, and spread our supper on
      a big napkin. When we had eaten, Mr. Pearl removed his coat and vest from
      a carpet-bag. He spread the coat over his shoulders, but hung the vest on
      a stick, which he had driven into the ground beside him. He had turned it
      inside out, so that two medals, pinned to its lining, could be seen in the
      firelight. &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; Mr. McCarthy asked. &ldquo;Medals of honor.&rdquo; The
      Pearl spoke carelessly as he was filling his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Medals of honor!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. McCarthy. &ldquo;How did you get 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won 'em in the Mexican War.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you wear 'em on the outside of your jacket?&rdquo; Air. McCarthy
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rise to a point of order,&rdquo; said the Pearl, as he got to his feet. &ldquo;If I
      had a thousand dollars, would I wear it on the outside o' my pocket? Or if
      I was Mr. McCarthy, would I have to tell people that I was a gentleman?&rdquo;
       The Pearl gathered power like a locomotive when he got to going. His words
      conveyed a message of special value to Mr. McCarthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never want to show your cards more than is necessary before you play
      'em,&rdquo; the Pearl continued. &ldquo;I could have used those medals to get a job
      many a time when I wouldn't, any more than you'd let a girl marry you out
      o' pity. There have been years when I wa'n't as good as the medals&mdash;there's
      the truth of it. Every night when I go to bed I hang that vest on a chair,
      wrong side out, an' take a look at 'em, an' try to make myself as good as
      they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how you won them?&rdquo; Mr. McCarthy urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't in the order o' exercises,&rdquo; the Pearl went on. &ldquo;The chair begs
      to advise the gentleman from Hermon Center that if he, the said gentleman,
      ever succeeds in doing a big thing, the sooner <i>he</i> forgets it the
      longer it will be remembered. If a man makes his history it's all that can
      be expected o' him. Somebody else ought to do the tellin', if it has to be
      told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's sound,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy, &ldquo;and I'm going to put it down in my
      note-book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm goin' to forget it,&rdquo; said the Pearl, as he began to prepare for bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were up at sunrise in the morning. Late that day we landed, and Pearl
      took the canoe on his back and we put across country. A walk of six miles
      brought us to our own river, and we saved thereby a day of water travel.
      The sun was low when we wet our canoe again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The committee on refreshments will please report,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl, when
      he had put down his load.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCarthy reported by laying out three pieces of cheese, half a dozen
      crackers, and a bit of dried beef.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pearl called &ldquo;Mr. Barker,&rdquo; and when the animal stood up before him,
      said: &ldquo;The chair respectfully suggests that without food it will soon have
      no leg to stand on. You should cultivate the virtue of thoughtfulness. Do
      not wait to be told, Mr. Barker, but always consider what is to be done,
      and do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the Pearl had advice to give he invariably addressed it to &ldquo;Mr.
      Barker,&rdquo; and so it came to us through the dog, as one might say, and was
      never lost upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCarthy and I hurried away, while Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pearl got a fire going. We were both ashamed that the idea of increasing
      our stores had not occurred to us. We returned soon with eggs and bacon,
      and new bread and coffee, and all needed appliances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move that the report be laid on the table,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl, as he began
      to warm the spider.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think always with a grateful heart of that supper, which we ate in the
      cool twilight, with a knoll for a table, and, for a cloth, a mat of grass
      interwoven with white clover blossoms. It was quite dusk when we launched
      the canoe and resumed our journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I words fit for beauty and delight, I should try to tell of our night
      journey on the river&mdash;of the wondrous flattery of moon and shadow, of
      wet banks showered with &ldquo;barbaric pearl,&rdquo; of geese that sailed by,
      magnified to swanlike size, of a little village on the shore, whose
      painted boards shone like white marble and filled the eye with illusions
      of splendor and grand proportion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were over the last carry at Mill Pond the hand-made gentleman fell
      asleep, but we kept on with a steady stroke of the paddles. I would not be
      the first to speak of stopping, for every stroke brought me nearer home,
      and the thought of it!&mdash;worth all the misery and peril I had known.
      Near two o'clock we got out on the shore, a mile below the Mill House, and
      lay down with our blankets and went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunlight and the robins wakened us. It was one of my best days&mdash;that
      of my return. So much of it has come along up the road with me! Especially
      I remember its glad faces and the touch of its loving hands, and the sound
      of its gentle voices and its peace. Who can estimate the value of such a
      day save one who has been blessed with it? True, the moments go like
      falling water, but they return and are never quite ended, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cascade seemed to sing a welcome with its big, hearty voice. The
      garden flowers expressed my happiness in color, and sent their perfume to
      bid me welcome at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pearl and the hand-made gentleman turned away while I went up the old
      stair with my arms around my mother and sister, now dearer than ever to
      me. We sat down upon the old sofa, and I began to ravel out my follies.
      They rose to prepare breakfast, and I looked about me. There were the
      familiar three commandments of my mother hanging on the wall:
    </p>
    <h3>
      BE TRUTHFUL. BE KIND. BE HAPPY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had told the truth to Mr. Weatherby I would never have gone away,&rdquo;
       was my remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more truth the less trouble,&rdquo; said my mother. &ldquo;It keeps you in the
      right road. If you're going to tell the truth you've got to make it worth
      telling, or, at least, good enough so that you will not be ashamed of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While we had learned those three commandments, not until now had I begun
      to feel the power in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked about me at all the familiar things: the pictures&mdash;especially
      a crayon portrait of my father&mdash;the mottos, wrought in colored yam.
      Wisdom was more available than art those days in the north country, and
      the walls of many a simple home were decorated with the sayings of bard or
      prophet, each neatly framed. My mother's mottos were all her own, however.
      She was a daughter of the pioneers who had learned much in a hard school
      of experience. The best of it all had come down to her, and was a bit
      refined by her own thought. There was a kind of history in those mottos
      that hung on the walls of the Mill House&mdash;the heart history of men
      who had had to think for themselves. I read them anew and thoughtfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The kindly will never want a friend;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The mean will never lack an enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      One good word deserves another,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But receives more than it deserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To-day is the best of all days,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But to-morrow will be better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Let heaven begin here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      After all my regretful thinking on that journey, which had now come to its
      end, these words began to fill with meaning. That last injunction, printed
      in golden threads, sank deeply into my heart and led to this conviction:
      that the Mill House was one of the outlying provinces of heaven; far
      removed, maybe, but still as much a part of it as those isles ten thousand
      miles from London are a part of the British Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast being ready, I went down after my good friends. The Pearl would
      not come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just hand me a little snack,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I ain't fit to go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would not yield to urging, and so I brought his breakfast to him, and
      he sat down and ate at the foot of the stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother and sister sat at the table with Mr. McCarthy and me. The
      manners of the handmade gentleman became exceedingly formal. He spoke only
      when spoken to, save when he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I be so bold as to ask for a glass of water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I suggested the subject of Sal, he began to relax, and went to his
      grip and gravely presented my mother with a dozen balls of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast over, my mother went below-stairs with me to thank Mr. Pearl
      for his kindness, but he was gone. I found her looking up the river, where
      he was going out of sight, far up the shaded avenue of water, in his
      canoe. She looked very sad as I walked to the garden with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us look at the flowers,&rdquo; she said, as she put her arm-about me.
      &ldquo;These roses have just opened this morning; they have been waiting for
      you, and so has this letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart quickened, for I had seen the postmark and the girlish penmanship
      on the envelope, and had caught its odor of violets. Eagerly I broke the
      seal, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Friend,&mdash;I have just been picking flowers and they reminded me
      of your letter. I have not forgotten you; everything that is beautiful
      makes me think of those days when you were here&mdash;we had such a good
      time; at least, I did. I should like to hear from you often, but I don't
      want you to think that I care so very, very much. I wouldn't want to have
      you try to remember me. I still have my troubles, but they are not quite
      so dreadful. Last night my father brought home another young man. I do not
      like him; he has such a queer way of staring into my eyes, and can talk of
      nothing but dogs and horses. Fannie has come back, and Sam is with her. He
      is going to take care of the garden and the grounds until they can find a
      farm. Fannie says that he has got over being afraid and is very
      affectionate. I think of you often, and of those pleasant evenings that we
      had together, and of all that you went through. I wonder if you would dare
      come again! Well, I am sure that I shall never get another letter from
      you, even, but I wish you good luck, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours truly, Jo.
    </p>
    <p>
      P. S.&mdash;I have made this letter short for fear it would bore you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my first letter from a fair maid, and what a state of mind it put
      me in! My mother read it with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a pretty letter,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so pretty as Jo,&rdquo; I answered. Then I told about my visit in
      Summerville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the girl is alone with that old drunkard?&rdquo; said my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too bad! I wish I could see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love her,&rdquo; I said, soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you're not yet sixteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A boy has feelings,&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I'm not in love, I'd like to know what it is that makes me feel as I
      do. I would die for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I know,&rdquo; she answered, holding my hand in hers. &ldquo;I was
      like you when I was a young miss&mdash;thought I was in love two or three
      times when I was not. Write to her if you wish, but you must be fair to
      her. Don't say a word about it until you see if it lasts. She may not care
      for you, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter made me sure that she did care for me, however, and that and
      others like it were, indeed, the treasures of my youth. The notion of
      being fair to her grew in me, for, after all, my heart had had its change,
      and was it now to be wholly trusted?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCarthy met us at the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been reading your three commandments,&rdquo; said he to my mother. &ldquo;Are
      they in the Bible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I got them out of the Book of Nature,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You learn to
      be truthful by the study of men, for what is a man unless he is himself&mdash;the
      thing he pretends to be? Kindness&mdash;I learned that from the earth,
      where we all reap as we sow, and everything that lives teaches us to be
      happy. These birds and flowers&mdash;see how happy they are! And this boy
      of mine just returned from the path of error&mdash;who could be happier
      than he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's sound,&rdquo; said the hand-made gentleman. &ldquo;I'm going to write it down
      in my book.&rdquo; He sat down and wrote while she helped him a little in the
      phrasing of his notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must devote myself to business,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy, when he had closed
      the book. &ldquo;I will visit the leading villages in the county, and return as
      expeditiously as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at me as if to note the effect of this impressive declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck; and remember here is always a good welcome,&rdquo; my mother said to
      him, as he took the road to Heartsdale.

    <p>
      R. PEARL had opened a little shop in Heartsdale. It was up an alley next
      to a large mill, where he could connect his shaft with river-power. A
      smooth board, lettered with his own brush and nailed above his door,
      contained the words:
    </p>
    <h3>
      PEARL &amp; COMPANY
    </h3>
    <p>
      One bright, still morning in the early summer I walked to Heartsdale to
      begin my career anew. My mother wished me to be near home, and I was on my
      way to the shop of B. Crocket &amp; Son, marble-cutters, who were making a
      monument for my father. They were going to teach me their trade.
      Heartsdale had always made me believe it very large and myself very
      little. Its buildings and its people had seemed to look down upon me from
      a great height. Now that I had been to Buffalo, that old feeling of awe
      and littleness had gone out of me and must be now, I believed, in the
      breast of Heartsdale itself, and I carried my head high.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the eminence of my conceit I got a full view of its languor and
      littleness. Even the river slowed its pace half a mile above and came on
      like a spent horse. Near the Mill House half a mile below it began to
      hurry, and always I had the stir of the rapids in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feet accustomed to the pace of the plow were going into town. The clink of
      an anvil broke the silence. I had often watched the great blacksmith as he
      worked. That clinking indicated the flow of his thought and the strength
      of his convictions. Words fell between hammer-strokes, and were often as
      hot as the beaten metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shop of B. Crocket &amp; Son, whither I was bound, stood on a narrow
      byway bordered with small wooden buildings. The shop itself had a little
      door-yard where headstones and monuments stood among blocks of marble.
      Inside were benches on which the stone was being trimmed, lettered, and
      polished. There everything was white with marble-dust. Mr. B. Crocket&mdash;called
      &ldquo;Judge Crocket&rdquo; by all who knew him, and so called because, in his own
      way, he pronounced judgment on those who lived and died about him&mdash;stood
      over a headstone cutting an epitaph. A number of men past middle age sat
      around a small table in one corner playing old sledge. They looked up at
      me as I entered. A man and a red-headed boy, the latter of about my age,
      were polishing a block of granite near the far end of the shop. I
      approached the Judge and bade him good-morning. He looked down out of gray
      eyes colder than the marble on which he leaned. His pale, wizened face was
      itself a wonderful bit of sculpture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the young Heron?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men who were playing cards began to laugh, and I was a bit stung by
      it, having a strong sense of dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mr. Heron,&rdquo; was my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; my new employer grunted. &ldquo;Take off your mister and your coat and
      vest and put on a pair of overalls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men laughed loudly, in spite of the fact that I had been to Buffalo. I
      felt inclined to resent his words, but held my tongue and did as he bade
      me, for I had brought some overalls in my satchel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on with his work, and said, presently, that his son would tell me
      what to do. The latter did not give me a mallet and chisel, as I had
      hoped, but set me polishing with the redheaded boy of my own age,
      familiarly known as &ldquo;Swipes.&rdquo; I had been reading the life of Michelangelo,
      which my mother had bought for me, and dreaming of high achievements. It
      had come to nothing but sweating over a hand-lathe and slopping in dirty
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of those who played at the table were old soldiers, the third a
      business man, the fourth a retired farmer. One, with an empty sleeve,
      entered presently and sat on a half-finished monument that lay near them,
      as if accepting the invitation cut in its polished face, &ldquo;Requiescat in
      pace.&rdquo; He begged a chew of tobacco, and began to talk, telling how he got
      tobacco hunger in a battle and searched for it in the pockets of the dead.
      The other soldiers took the cue and told of many a like adventure as they
      played their game. The retired farmer was not unlike them, for he, too,
      had begun his long rest. He of the one arm passed a bottle as the game
      ended. Then all seemed to pry themselves out of their chairs with levers
      of necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to go,&rdquo; said one, as he yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So've I,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here goes,&rdquo; said number three. All rose, save one, and tried their
      creaking joints.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Bulford Boggs, the undertaker, who remained in his chair&mdash;he
      that was known far and wide as &ldquo;Bull&rdquo; Boggs. His shop was across the way,
      and a line of parlor furniture filled its front window. He was a
      full-bodied man with a prominent nose and a short upper lip, and wore a
      high flaring collar and side-whiskers, now turned gray, and got soothing
      draughts of indolence from a big, meerschaum pipe. I remember that his
      nose and front and calm expression reminded me of a meadow-lark. It did
      seem to me often that he resented human life. There were times when, as he
      looked at one, his whole manner thus expressed itself: &ldquo;What! you living?
      Good Heavens, man! How do you expect me to get along in business and you
      living on forever? Why don't you go hang yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon Mr. Crocket, who had been working silently on a headstone, rested his
      chisel and looked at Mr. Boggs. Then he read, with quaint irony, the
      flattering inscription that he had finished:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was her turn,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She was the survivor of three husbands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued pecking at the stone and also at the character of the
      deceased lady. His monologue was broken by the sound of his mallet, and I
      remember it went on as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't even live with herself [whack]. Tried it [whack], an' died
      [whack].&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boggs gave a roar of joy as he held his big pipe in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reminds me of Harrison White [whack, whack]. He traded me a horse for a
      family monument, an'&mdash;wal, he got it for nothing. That horse began to
      waste away. Come to find out he was twenty-four years old. The horse got
      the heaves, an' Harrison got religion, but I got nothing. Come here one
      day an' offered to pray for me [whack], I told him to pray for the old
      horse. He gave me up. The old horse died an' so did Harrison. Oh, I've
      seen 'em come an' go for a good many years [whack, whack, whack]. What do
      you suppose they wrote out for an inscription to go under his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard once, but I've forgotten,&rdquo; growled the undertaker. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He paid the debt,'&rdquo; said the Judge, soberly, with another whack. &ldquo;I
      added something free of charge, an' it was this, 'but not the one due me.&mdash;B.
      Crocket.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boggs, who sat watching the door of his shop across the way as he
      listened, let out his mirth in heavy bolts of sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was to be a political meeting, and the town was filling up with
      people. Mr. Crocket and his friend went to the open door of the
      marble-shop and looked at the crowds passing in the main street. Soon the
      Judge returned to his task, and Mr. Boggs stood looking out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've all got to die,&rdquo; said the latter, cheerfully, as he surveyed the
      people. &ldquo;Whenever I get blue I just think o' that an' take courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These hard old cynics were to me a new kind of people. They rejoiced in
      death&mdash;in the destruction of hopes, in the slaughter of reputations.
      Their rough word-play gave my young soul a shock that I have not yet
      forgotten. It went on day after day, while I wore away the cold marble and
      my tender youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole place and its people reminded me of those lines which I had
      heard the minister quote in a sermon:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;The knell, the shroud, the mattock, and the grave,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The deep, dank vault, the darkness, and the worm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But I made no complaint, for my first undertaking had come to naught, and
      if I failed again what would they think of me&mdash;especially Jo and my
      mother. My employer pecked away at the epitaphs with his chisel and
      amended them with his conversation. Every morning Mr. Boggs and his three
      companions sat in a corner playing old sledge and boarding their cards
      with appalling thumps in trying stages of the game, and, after each hand',
      loudly confessing their calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we don't win this game I'll bury you for nothing,&rdquo; was one of the
      cheering and familiar promises of Mr. Boggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The undertaker had a wise and threatening air about him. He often bullied
      people, using loud words and a pouncing manner. Sometimes he gave advice
      with a wearied look of toleration, and oh, the sadness of Mr. Boggs at a
      funeral!
    </p>
    <p>
      The three friends went away soon after eleven o'clock, whereupon, if there
      were &ldquo;nothing doing&rdquo;&mdash;an oft-repeated phrase of the undertaker&mdash;he
      used to sit talking with the Judge or reading a newspaper. One day he fell
      asleep in his chair. Mr. Crocket printed this inscription on a sheet of
      cardboard and leaned it against the knees of the undertaker:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      <i>Sacred to the Memory of B. Boggs</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge surveyed him with a playful eye, and added, &ldquo;He is certainly the
      flower o' the village.&rdquo; It was an apt symbol, for he was, indeed, one of
      the most perfect flowers of rustic commercialism that ever bloomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village boys relieved the monotony of my life with sundry insults.
      Having travelled far, as I thought, and endured many perils, and having,
      moreover, a proud spirit, I was, for my age and size, a bit nearer the
      goal of manhood than most of them, and my dignity was natural enough. They
      resented it with jeers and epithets and stickings out of the tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crocket and his son went home at five, while I and the red-headed boy
      continued our labor until six o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swipes himself was a melancholy youth who had once swallowed a
      shingle-nail and who cherished a great fear of it. For poor Swipes that
      shingle-nail was like the sword of Damocles. The first evening that we
      were alone together in the shop he confided his worst fears to me, and
      asked if I knew of any medicine that would be likely to do him good. He
      complained of pain in the pit of his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've took half a bottle of horse liniment that I found here in the shop,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;It may help some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was deeply interested in the great fist-fighters, and his hero was John
      Morrissey. In the last hour of work one day, after the Crockets had gone
      home, three or four boys of about our age gathered in the shop. We had
      removed our overalls and were getting ready to go, when Swipes approached
      me. His fists were moving playfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could put an epitaph on that face o' your'n,&rdquo; he threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be your epitaph,&rdquo; I answered, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others laughed and urged me to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to jump up and down, with his fists out in front of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fight me, fight me, if you ain't a coward!&rdquo; he hissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That word was more than I could endure. I flew at Swipes like a panther
      and floored him. He rose, bleeding, but unwhipped. We fought fiercely up
      and down among the gravestones, and in a moment were locked together. I
      had the under hold and forced him into the water-tub. Swipes said that
      would do, and I released my hold upon him. He rose, dripping, and offered
      me his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're all right,&rdquo; said he, cheerfully. &ldquo;I only wanted to know if you
      could fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a kind of pride in his bruised face, and would not let me wash away
      the blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly another boy began to dance in front of me. It was a desperate
      battle I had then, and Swipes, when he saw me getting the worst of it,
      broke in for the sake of fairness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You tackled him when he was tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bout ended, and Swipes gave me his hand with a cheering word as I left
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told 'em you could fight,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a hard week of it then, for they were bound to know what I was made
      of&mdash;those warlike and barbaric people. I avenged my wrongs, and
      stepped off the plane of reprobation and contempt forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to like my task, and worked hard and spent three evenings a week
      with Mr. Pearl. He lived in his little shop, and had been kind enough to
      offer me what help he could in my studies. He had some learning, a rare
      talent in mathematics, and a genius for explanation. I brought my suppers
      with me, and we often ate together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time I entered the shop, after my week of battle, the Pearl
      looked at me and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound that dog!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog stood up before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've often talked to you about fighting,&rdquo; said the Pearl. &ldquo;I want t' tell
      you again it's poor business, Mr. Barker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's an awful quarrelsome cuss,&rdquo; he added, as he dismissed the dog and
      turned to me with an apology for delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had scarcely begun our work when Mr. McCarthy entered. He had two good
      legs under him&mdash;so one might have thought&mdash;and a shoe on each
      foot, and a step like that of a sound man. He was &ldquo;all dressed up,&rdquo; as
      they used to say, and a bit too well aware of it. He took off his hat and
      bowed politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentleman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Mr. McCarthy presents his compliments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that your off foot is on,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's better than ever,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy. &ldquo;That's good!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      Pearl. &ldquo;You can now make footprints in the sands of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've got a pair o' feet and a new leg on my body, and five thousand
      dollars in the bank, and more coming,&rdquo; Mr. McCarthy went on, while we were
      dumb with amazement. &ldquo;You'll find Sal in every drug store north of the
      Central Road, and I'm going to spread it all over Vermont and
      Massachusetts. Two or three rivals have sprung up, and I've bought 'em
      out. I've got forty people at work in my central factory, which is at
      Rushwater, New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's geared for high power,&rdquo; said the Pearl, as he turned to me. &ldquo;He's
      got his belt on the main shaft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The compliment pleased Mr. McCarthy. His eyes glowed and his fist flashed
      down upon the bench before him with a loud thump. It was the deep fire of
      his spirit showing itself in a kind of lightning thrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to be somebody!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can find use for it, you'll get all the power you need right off
      the big engine,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What engine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one that runs the universe. When you've got accommodation for high
      power it always comes to you. Then look out for the friction an' you're
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a moment of silence he turned to me and said: &ldquo;I've heard about the
      three commandments of your house. They're like those of my shop: Take your
      power off the main shaft&mdash;that means truth. Oil your bearings&mdash;kindness.
      Reduce friction as much as possible&mdash;happiness. And that reminds me,
      how is your gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pearl turned to Mr. McCarthy as he put the query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little more polished,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;I think his deportment has
      improved, an' he can converse upon many subjects or write an elegant
      letter. He's a little more natural, as ye might say, and has so much else
      to think of he's kind o' forgot himself. He reads the New York <i>Herald</i>
      every day, and can hold an argument on politics or religion. He knows all
      the points in favor of the protection of home industries, an' has learnt
      every great fact in American history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except one,&rdquo; said the Pearl of great price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A new thing discovered by H. M. Pearl, Esq., which is singular an'
      likewise worthy of your attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pearl paused for a moment while he looked at him. &ldquo;A stream o' power
      is rushing over those wires,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I'll turn it into another
      channel an' put a brake on it. Then you'll see some actions calculated to
      produce loud and continued applause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put out his lamp and stepped away in the darkness. I heard the turn of
      a lever and then the room was flooded with light. We gazed at it with a
      feeling of awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are sticks of carbon,&rdquo; said he, pointing at the centre of the glow.
      &ldquo;When the current strikes the carbon it comes into hard sledding; there's
      the rub, an' the rub makes heat an' the heat gives light, and the light
      gives history and feelin's of surprise an' happiness in the breast of H.
      M. Pearl, Esq. Wait until he gets the voltage he needs and he can turn
      night into day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by voltage?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took us over to the hose tank that was fastened high in a corner, and
      turned the faucet. Water came pouring through the hose into a large tub on
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The voltage is the squirt of the stream, and the size of it is the
      amperage, and the watts is the hole it would make in the snow. Do you know
      why so many men use tobacco in this town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High voltage and little to do,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Currents o' power are
      flowin' into us, but&mdash;Lord!&mdash;we don't know what to do with it.
      We have no purpose, no gear, no machinery. So we let it off in all kinds
      o' folly. Look at the merchants&mdash;some of 'em are strong men, but
      every one has got his belt on a pinwheel. There's twenty of 'em an' work
      enough for two. The only men in town who are sure of a good living are the
      undertaker and the carver of epitaphs. We all die, if we don't do anything
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We turned again to the light and expressed our wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie low an' say nothin',&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl, as he turned the lever. &ldquo;I'll
      make 'em roll in their sleep one o' these days. All I need is money for
      patents an' tools an' material.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll furnish it some day,&rdquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' we'll share the profits,&rdquo; said H. M. Pearl, Esq., as they shook
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Henry McCarthy and I left the shop together. I asked him to go home
      with me, but he had to leave early next day, and so had taken quarters at
      the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Miss Fame?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; was his answer. &ldquo;Do you suppose she'd care for me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think she would,&rdquo; was my answer. &ldquo;But I shall not ask her,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;I thought when I got my leg and handsome clothes and some money that
      I'd be good enough for any one; but when I went to see her the other day,
      it seemed as if she was a little cooler, if anything.&rdquo; There was a note of
      sadness in the voice of Mr. McCarthy. He went on in a moment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I conversed with her on the subject of the Republican nominations. I
      dropped into history and gave a quotation from Shakespeare, just to show
      her that I was no fool, if I was the son of old Jack McCarthy. I guess I
      let out about everything that I knew. I just told her that I was making
      money, but I didn't talk shop&mdash;you know, gentlemen never do that.
      By-an'-by she took my hand an' said: 'You're doing finely, James. I'm
      delighted that you're getting along so well.' It seemed as if that was the
      worst thing she could have said to me&mdash;the same old twaddle&mdash;as
      if I needed a pat on the back. She never asked me to call again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let it worry you,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued. &ldquo;After all, it isn't legs or clothes or deportment or money
      or doing as you'd be done by that makes a gentleman&mdash;though they help
      a good deal. You've got to be all right, and then forget it, and it can't
      be done in a day. I'm like a new pair o' boots&mdash;they pinch a little
      here and there, and have got too much of a squeak in 'em.&rdquo;

      R. CROCKET played a bass horn which had belonged to his father. He had
      much to say about &ldquo;the cause of good music in Hearts-dale,&rdquo; and both he
      and Mr. Boggs were members of its Comet Band. Therein lay the weakest
      point in Mr. Crocket's character. He did not lie or use tobacco or strong
      drink or profanity, but I have thought sometimes that he would have done
      well to change his sin for one more private and compact, for the old horn
      cut a swath a mile wide in the silence. It had a part in the string as
      well as the brass band of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, more than a year after my initiation to the shop, there was to
      be a celebration of the nomination of Lincoln for President and an address
      by Colonel Remington. Capes and helmets for the musicians had been sent to
      the marble-shop and were stored away in a closet. Swipes and I had
      discovered them. Now, it should be explained that Swipes regarded his
      shingle-nail with growing apprehension. He had come to work with a
      poultice of mustard that morning. I had seen him spitefully withdraw it
      from his bosom and fling it under his bench. When the Messrs. Crocket had
      gone home we talked of the shingle-nail, and I observed that he had great
      respect for the mustard and more confidence in his future. He declared
      that his pains had been drawn to the outside of his body, and he thought
      that a safer place for them. He showed me the blister, and as we surveyed
      the same an evil purpose entered the mind of Swipes, and I regret to say
      that it overflowed into my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The helmets had a partial lining of thin cloth attached to the visor.
      Beneath the lining of each one we spread a mustard paste where it would
      afflict the forehead of the player. That done, we ate our suppers and went
      out to see the crowd. At half-past seven the musicians appeared in front
      of the Opera-House, and began work at once. Soon I observed that three or
      four of the players had begun to perspire, and were moving the skin of
      their foreheads. The clarionet lagged and fell out of time. Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crocket lost the run of the score, and went roaring on for a moment and
      abandoned the chase. Swipes nudged me as the marble-cutter removed his
      helmet. The others were struggling with their parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clarionet player began to talk to himself. The crowd was laughing at
      the discords. The Heartsdale Cornet Band suddenly gave up, and, oddly
      enough, on the first phrase of <i>Hail Columbia</i>. Every player
      uncovered and felt his forehead and began to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boggs muttered and seemed to threaten his neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel as if I'd blown my brains out,&rdquo; said the clarionet player.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This helmet ought to be spelt with a double <i>l</i>,&rdquo; said Mr. Crocket,
      as he felt the inside of his head-cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, we stayed too long and laughed too much. Mr. Crocket
      discovered us, and had a stern and suspicious look. We retreated promptly,
      and heard no more from the band until next morning. We met on the street
      and entered the shop together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said the Judge, &ldquo;I've got a present for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; Swipes inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hellmets,&rdquo; said the marble-cutter, spelling the word with a double <i>l</i>,
      after he had spoken it&mdash;&ldquo;a pair of 'em; one for each of you. Try 'em
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not dare refuse the honor, and poor Swipes had the same feeling. The
      helmets were on our heads in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're becoming,&rdquo; said Mr. Crocket. &ldquo;I like to see 'em on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled them down and fastened them with a strong cord. He seemed to
      enjoy tying the knot beneath our chins, and drew it tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      We began our work, and were presently in the tortures of full atonement.
      Swipes dropped his tools by-and-by, and tried in vain to raise the helmet
      a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess somebody has put some mustard in this helmet,&rdquo; said he, in a loud
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mustard!&rdquo; Mr. Crocket exclaimed. &ldquo;Nobody would be mean enough for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; Swipes persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you're mistaken,&rdquo; said Mr. Crocket, calmly, as he resumed his
      work. &ldquo;Leastways, if there is mustard in 'em, it's only meant for a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boggs, who sat in his corner, began to roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's hard when ye have to invent the joke an' take it, too,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Crocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swipes seized the cord and put all his strength upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fool, don't you know it's funny?&rdquo; said the marble-cutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swipes could see no occasion for laughter, and continued to pull the
      string until it came free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, boy, if you can't take your own medicine you'll have to take
      mine,&rdquo; said Mr. Crocket, sternly. &ldquo;You may pick up your things an' go; I'm
      done with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Swipes! Things had come to a bad turn for him, and his lips were
      trembling as he prepared to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of him, then, was more to me than my own torture. He was poor
      and sorely needed his place. I should not have done, or permitted him to
      do, an act so foolish as that we had been guilty of.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I spoke up for him with odd mendacity: &ldquo;It was my fault, Mr. Crocket.
      Swipes is not to blame. I put the mustard into those helmets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is past finding out&mdash;the things a boy will do when he is put to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you did,&rdquo; said the marble-cutter, &ldquo;you little-souled, narrer,
      contracted cuss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes seemed to be searching me for other qualities likely to serve his
      scorn. He added, with a look of sternness: &ldquo;Boy, you've done a great
      injury to the cause of good music in Heartsdale!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered if music had suffered more than I, and, answered, timidly: &ldquo;It
      was only meant for a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the joke is on you,&rdquo; said Mr. Crocket, with a rude look at me. &ldquo;You
      are both discharged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So my second trial in business came to its end, and people began to shake
      their heads and say that I was a wild boy and would come to no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the shop of my old friends, &ldquo;Pearl &amp; Barker,&rdquo; and told of my
      trouble. The Pearl had a thoughtful look on his face, and said nothing for
      a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound that dog!&rdquo; he exclaimed, presently, and began to call Mr.
      Barker. The dog stood up before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You rascal!&rdquo; the Pearl began, &ldquo;you'll have to take another dose. I trust
      that you will soon be a dog, Mr. Barker, an' get over bein' a puppy. Not
      that I would have you too good&mdash;there are no angels in this world,
      Mr. Barker. But I am moved to suggest that you always show proper respect
      for age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every word that he said to &ldquo;Mr. Barker&rdquo; sank into my soul, and made me see
      how foolish I had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those in favor of reform will please say aye,&rdquo; said the Pearl, and Mr.
      Barker and I both voted loudly. &ldquo;It seems to be carried&mdash;it is
      carried,&rdquo; the Pearl went on, and then, turning to me, he added: &ldquo;That dog
      is getting a good deal of useful knowledge. It may be worth your while to
      whack up with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was said gently, and yet, somehow, the words fell like a lash. I went
      home sore with remorse and wrote a letter of apology to Judge Crocket, and
      fully confessed my folly.

    <p>
      HAT evening there came a rap at our door, and when I opened it who should
      walk in upon us but Sam&mdash;the apprehensive and affectionate Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      I presented him to my mother and sister, and he removed his cap and coat
      and sat down with us. In his Sunday suit and manners Sam was neither
      cheerful nor communicative. I tried to talk with him of the days we had
      known together, but he only smiled and shook his head with, now and then,
      a timid exclamation. When my mother and sister had gone to bed he nudged
      my leg and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le' 's go outdoors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went down the road together, and he turned to me and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm up a stump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deviltry, which is a caution,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Colonel,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you leave him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my duty to stan' it, an' I'll have to. Don't have much to do but
      sleep with the Colonel, an' that's a man's work. It takes an uncommon kind
      of a man, too. You have to praise his strength an' look at his wounds an'
      hear him sing an' be shoved around the bedroom an' get your head thumped
      on the wall, an' run for your life when he chases ye. He wants to rassle
      an' pull fingers about every night. Sometimes he comes home drunk an' sets
      an' sings like a bird at two o'clock in the morning. I have to get up an'
      pull his boots off an' let him shove me around. It ain't an easy job, but
      it's better than some, an' we can't leave Jo alone with him. I've got to
      put up with it. One night he drove me all over the place with a kind of a
      spear. I didn't know but he was goin' to stick me with it. By-an'-by I see
      that he wasn't vicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One evenin' a young feller come there when the Colonel was away, an'
      behaved himself improper. Jo told Fannie, an' I went an' kicked him out o'
      the house. The Colonel was wild when he heard of it. He wouldn't allow a
      boy on the place after that. The first one that come he grabbed a sword
      off the wall an' made for him. The boy run like a scairt deer, an' the
      Colonel chased him acrost the door-yard an' half-way to the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day the Colonel found a letter from you to Jo. He see that you was in
      love with her, an' flew mad an' forbid her to write to you, an' I come to
      tell ye. He won't let her go on the street alone, which is agoin' too fur&mdash;altogether.
      Jo is a lady&mdash;don't you forget it. There's only one man that comes to
      the house, an' he's a friend o' the Colonel. I guess he's a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jo's silence had worried me, and now this attitude of her father filled me
      with alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;do you think she cares for me?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I do,&rdquo; he answered, promptly. &ldquo;There's every sign of it. She
      promised him that she wouldn't write to you&mdash;she had to do it, I
      guess, an' she wanted me to come an' bring you this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and gave me a small package.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Colonel has had a fortune come to him,&rdquo; my friend went on. &ldquo;He's
      goin' to move to the old homestead in Merrifield, an' it ain't over twenty
      mile from here. They'll move in the spring&mdash;soon as the snow's off&mdash;an'
      maybe things 'll change by then, so you can come an' see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You write me when to come, and I'll be there if it's a possible thing,&rdquo;
       was my answer..
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam questioned me as to my work and pay, and I gave him all the
      particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to get into bigger business,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Jo's a lady. I
      ain't goin' to tell 'em that you're smoothin' rocks. It don't fit ye&mdash;someway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's respectable,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I've been studying every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I didn't have the courage to speak of my discharge, and I hoped, too, that
      Mr. Crocket would soon take me back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to be a big gun if you're goin' to fit her, there ain't any
      two ways about that. You'd better go to school, an', if you need it, I'll
      lend you a little money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked the big-hearted fellow, and said that I would consult my mother
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You set down an' write her a letter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an' I'll see that she
      gets it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Colonel&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain't forbid <i>you</i> to write, has he?&rdquo; Sam went on. &ldquo;You write her
      a good, long, high-toned letter, such as a lady ought to get. You know how
      to do it. Don't speak o' the rocks. I've told 'em that you was a
      gentleman, an' very partic'lar fine in every way, shape, an' manner, an' I
      guess she b'lieves it. She can marry the best chap in the land if she
      wants to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took his hard hand in mine. &ldquo;Sam, you're a friend worth having,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You done me a favor once,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;an' I ain't forgot it, an' never
      will, an' I'm goin' to help you in any way that I can. Do you remember
      when I was married? She just took hold o' my bit an' give me a slap on the
      side, an' walked me up to the neck-yoke where I belonged, an', old boy,
      I'd go through fire an' water for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not write to Jo at present,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It wouldn't be fair to the
      Colonel. We must win him over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We climbed the hanging stair, and I conducted Sam to the spare room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; Sam exclaimed, &ldquo;I ain't got to hear about battles or the last
      rose o' summer, an' prob'ly I won't have to jump out an' rassle in the
      dead o' the night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took the little package Sam had given me to my room, and when it was
      undone there lay the horruck, wrapped in a sheet of paper which contained
      these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I have read the delightful message of the horruck. I send it back, and
      it will do for a letter.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat for hours trying to solve the riddle, and fell asleep in my chair
      by-and-by. When I awoke the horruck was gone. It had dropped from my hand,
      no doubt, but, although I looked high and low, I was not able to find it.
      Had Lizzie McCormick returned in my sleep and taken it away? The thing had
      left me as mysteriously as it came.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to bed and lay awake, hearing the roar of the falling water, and
      the thought came to me that my own life was like a river now, creeping
      over the flats. Maybe it would gather power and go on with a rush
      by-and-by.

    <p>
      Y sister was now in the Heartsdale Academy, and my mother and I had a
      wholesome pride in her. It was partly for her sake, I must confess to you,
      that I had been in a when my desire would have sent me to school. One of
      us had to work, and there were many reasons for my sacrifice, and no
      credit due me. In a dozen houses I knew one might have seen better deeds:
      mothers working nights, sons and daughters hired for long hours and hard
      labor, and with no clothes fit for a holiday, so that some one of the
      children could go to college or the normal school.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sister had many friends&mdash;boys and girls of her own age&mdash;who
      came to visit her. She was a comely girl, and sprightly and light of heart
      as a bird in the springtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home I had either a book or a biscuit in my hand always&mdash;so my
      mother said of me. The supper dishes out of the way, our table was drawn
      to the fireside and our big lamp glowed upon us until past ten o'clock.
      What a magic in its light and the silent hours! Far tribes and peoples,
      the sayings of wise men, immortal tales and poems, the wonders of art and
      invention, were gathered into the lamplight. Above all, I enjoyed the
      poets, even the best of them, and committed pages of classic verse, and
      had burning thoughts of great accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went one night to the Thanksgiving ball at Jones'&mdash;I and my sister
      and some of her schoolmates&mdash;in a big sleigh. It was, I may say,
      historic, being the last of its kind in the neighborhood. We were not to
      see again the careless, old-time frolic. The bass horn, also, was
      thenceforth banished from like scenes forever. The big fire came, and the
      telegraph followed in the early spring, and the railroad in the summer;
      and new brick buildings, including that of the Hearts-dale Academy, and
      many students and workingmen. A new editor appeared who began to poke fun
      at the old fashions. Then came the dress-suit, and novel forms of
      entertainment, and a big fire-engine. All these things had their effect
      upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crocket appeared at this last of the oldtime dances. He sat with the
      fiddler, and came in, now and then, with a long streak or a sudden splash
      of bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between dances we heard the bells ringing and hurried out-of-doors. A
      light rose high in the heavens above Heartsdale. The village was afire,
      and we made a rush for coats and caps, and our horses were soon speeding
      along the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rogers block was burning, and what a scene it was! A squad worked on a
      force-pump at the town well. Men rushed aimlessly about shouting orders
      mingled with profanity. Others swore back at them with equal emphasis.
      Every one had a plan of his own. A few were arguing loudly face to face.
      Mr. Boggs stood looking on with an &ldquo;I-told-you-so&rdquo; expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some were bravely at work in the heat passing water-buckets. One was on a
      roof near the fire playing the hose. They said he was H. M. Pearl. I saw
      the ladder he had climbed, and the thought came to me that here was my
      chance at last, and I made my way up it through heat and smoke to the side
      of my friend. As I fought the falling cinders I wondered if Jo would ever
      hear of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fire has got more power than we have!&rdquo; Pearl shouted to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked for a few minutes only when the water gave out. The fire had
      been forcing us back, and a blast now and then scorched our faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to adjourn,&rdquo; said Pearl; and we slid down the smoking ladder
      with blistered hands and faces, and our coats afire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heartsdale was more than half destroyed that night, and the marble-shop
      was in ruins. Pearl had seen the truth&mdash;the village had not power
      enough for its foe. Every day or two some town or city was burning up for
      that reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country is like a boy that has outgrown his strength,&rdquo; Pearl said to
      me. &ldquo;It needs more power; that stream o' water didn't have squirt enough
      to drown a bee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And better management,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Power and management go hand in hand,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When power comes it will
      bring brains along with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wrote an account of my adventure on the roof for the weekly <i>Courier</i>.
      It was published over my full name, and not since have I so pleased
      myself. Did not the editor speak of me as &ldquo;a polished writer&rdquo; and &ldquo;a brave
      lad&rdquo;? I read it over again and again, and sent a marked copy to my friends
      in Summerville.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Courier</i> of that week was full of history.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were lines in it by some unknown writer which put an end to the
      despotic sway of the bass horn. These lines were, in a way, the Magna
      Charta of Heartsdale, which thereafter might have been described as a
      limited monarchy. Let me read a moment:

      HOSE days they were stringing wires through the North, and even there
      human thought had begun to move faster. Now one could fling his words far
      over the distant hills in a moment. Men gathered in groups and talked of
      the wonder of it, and looked with awe upon the operator; for had not
      tidings of far capitals come to him out of the sky, and news of death
      which had made the strong tremble?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pearl had been helping to install a new line. For a time&mdash;a long
      time, as it seemed to me&mdash;the shop door was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night of his return I found him overhauling instruments at his bench,
      but as I came in he dropped his work and his face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How goes it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swift,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I've been helping 'em lay a track for lightning. A
      stream o' power is flashing over the hills to Merrifield this minute. Do
      you see that wire that goes by the window there? Well, it's a nerve out o'
      the brain o' the universe, an' we're connected. It makes us a part o' the
      great body o' the world, as ye might say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's goin' to be a war between life an' death in this country. In
      Heartsdale you an' I will lead the new army. Boggs an' Crocket will
      command the old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That little shop was for me &ldquo;the House of the Interpreter,&rdquo; and there I
      began to get the drift of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a book which contained the Morse alphabet, and taught me to
      make the letters on a telegraph key, and showed me how it checked the
      current and so produced the dots and dashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll run a wire to your house,&rdquo; he promised, &ldquo;an' we'll string our
      thoughts on it an' learn some useful knowledge. I can get a place for you
      as soon as you can read an' send the current, I never liked the headstone
      business. It's at the wrong end o' the line. If it was the cradle
      business, I'd like it better. Life is the thing for you an' me, not death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's four churches and two cemeteries in this little town. Life here
      has been a kind o' preparation for the grave, an' not much else. Death has
      done most o' the business. It's time we had a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was to help the swift, mysterious current of power to quicken the minds
      of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pearl lent me a telegraph key, and I stayed at home with my mother and
      sister for a few weeks, learning how to sound the letters on it. I went
      often to Pearl's shop of an evening and talked with him by telegraphy, and
      he was pleased with my progress, and within a month said I was good enough
      for any place on the line. We felt his kindness deeply there in the Mill
      House, and my mother wrote her thanks to him, and begged him to come and
      sup and spend the evening with us any day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend and fellow-citizen,&rdquo; said Mr. Pearl, when I saw him again,
      &ldquo;nothing would please me better than to sit by your fireside and enjoy all
      that exalts and embellishes civilized life. But, firstly, I am not decent
      enough; and, secondly, my clothing is fit only for the 'sacred precinks'
      o' my own shop, as Mr. Boggs would say; and, thirdly, I have a lot to do
      an' only sixteen hours a day to do it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he never came to the Mill House, and, although my mother had called
      twice at his shop to tell her gratitude, she had not been able to find
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he gave me glad news in this manner: &ldquo;How would ye like a job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a job?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To jerk lightnin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was his way of describing the work of an operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like it very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're to take the office in Heartsdale at forty dollars a month on
      trial,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It staggered me&mdash;the prospect of such opulence&mdash;and that very
      day I began my work. I have been lucky and prospered rather handsomely
      since then, but I have never received a sum so enduring and massive as
      that which came to me at the end of every month. I always hurried home
      with the roll of bills and flung it into my mother's lap proudly. Oh, what
      a lavish hand was mine those days! About the best happiness of all my life
      was in the few moments of sublime generosity at the month's end when I
      renounced the money and saw the look in my mother's face and hurried away
      to my chores. And when I saw the splendor of my sister's hats and gowns,
      and the neatness of her shoes, and heard people speak of her beauty, I was
      about as happy as one may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had &ldquo;jerked lightning&rdquo; some eight months and had become a figure in the
      life of Heartsdale, for I guided the flying horse of God that sped in and
      out of the village on its slender highway, and I was looked upon as a kind
      of sorcerer. Moreover, I&mdash;a boy of seventeen&mdash;received the
      princely income of forty dollars a month!
    </p>
    <p>
      In all this time, although I had written to Jo about the loss of the
      horruck and my ignorance of its secret and my growing curiosity, no word
      of her had come to me save a letter from Sam, which told me that Jo was
      well and hoped those few lines would find me the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon my call came clicking into the sounder with the letters M.
      F. behind it. I knew that M. F. stood for the office at Merrifield.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operator said that he would have an important message for me at eight
      that evening, and, asked if I could be at the key to take it. The request
      was not unusual, for mine was the repeating office at the junction of two
      lines. I promised to be on hand, and went to the office at eight o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon I got the call and answered it, and these words flashed into the
      sounder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Mr. Heron?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I answered, &ldquo;Yes; who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the operator at Merrifield, and I have a message for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go ahead,&rdquo; I clicked, impatiently. I could see it was a new
      operator with a rather timid hand. So the message ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Jacob Ezra Heron:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you still care to hear from an old friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo.
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered that very moment:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To Jo:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am dying for news of you. Answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cricket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I asked, &ldquo;Can you deliver the message to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it has been delivered. I am Jo,&rdquo; the sounder clicked. &ldquo;This is
      confidential. See if any one is on the line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rang off the calls of the hill circuit and got no answer, and knew we
      had the wire to ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you an operator?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I had to have a talk with you, and so here I am, at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather talk face to face than with lightning,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why can't I
      go and see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now. Wait a little while,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's a long story. There's a young man who came here from New York
      last summer. He's a friend of father's, and knows you. Since they met, my
      father has asked me not to see or write to you until he could get some
      information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bonaparte Squares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's Bony Squares!&rdquo; I clicked. &ldquo;I know him very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know him better than I ever wished to,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;He has tried
      to make love to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tried to make love to you!&rdquo; I exclaimed, with indignation. &ldquo;I cannot
      believe it. Your father had better get some information about him. Tell
      him to write to the postmaster of Heartsdale. Any one here or at Mill Pond
      could tell him all about Bony. He couldn't marry you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause of two or three seconds, and then the sounder answered,
      timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wouldn't let him,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no danger,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except for Bony,&rdquo; I flashed back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I held my ear close to the sounder for fear of missing a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too young to think of marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until you have consulted me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I know things that you must know
      before then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask father to write to your postmaster about his friend,&rdquo; she
      continued, as if she thought I had things to tell about Bony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let them turn you against me,&rdquo; I urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't fear. If I had another horruck I would send it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was never able to read the horruck's riddle,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you didn't know!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought you meant it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say until I know the message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wouldn't dare tell you. It's one thing to say it yourself, and
      another to speak with the horruck. You must find and study it. Goodnight!
      My dear old father is dozing here beside me, and doesn't dream that I am
      talking to you. I feel guilty, but I was afraid that you would come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say good-night. I'm not half through talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we mustn't say everything at once, and he is tired. We'll have
      another talk. Goodnight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I closed the office, and started for my home. As I walked alone in the
      darkness under the singing wires, I got my first broad view of their
      mission. My sweetheart and I were miles apart, but that rushing power on
      the string of metal had almost removed the distance and helped us to
      understand each other. Would it not, by-and-by, remove seas and continents
      and make all the races of one mind, and keep them in peace and good-will?

      EARL had invented a water-turbine, a dynamo, and a method of producing
      light by electricity, and many valuable devices, but had been able to
      patent only two of them. It is curious how, when there is universal need
      of a thing, men agree, without ever a word between them, that it shall be
      done, and nothing is so wonderful as the likeness of their energy and
      inspiration, as the rhythm of their hammer-strokes, the world over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pearl, struggling in the privacy of his little shop, was marching, step by
      step, with the great inventors, and never even suspected it until his best
      devices were a matter of record in the Patent Office to the credit of
      other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening I found him asleep on his bench. A hand hung over the edge,
      and a letter had dropped from it. His scarred face had a weary look. I
      turned to leave without disturbing him when he awoke and greeted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jake, I'm tired,&rdquo; said he, as he rose, yawning, and began to fill his
      pipe. &ldquo;I ain't up to the mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had a fall,&rdquo; he said, passing the letter. &ldquo;Read that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I read the news which had disappointed him, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday I was a great man, an' wouldn't have sold out for a million
      dollars. I've rolled off the lap of luxury an' hit the floor with a bump.
      Old Aunt Luxury is a long lady, an' no mistake. It's forty feet to her
      knees, an' a good deal of a tumble. You see before you a melancholy ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let me lend you some money. I'll trust you with all I've
      got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had just received my pay, and showed it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so poor that I wouldn't trust myself,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;an' that bein'
      so, I wouldn't ask you to trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left me to get some wood for the fire, and I saw a Bible lying on his
      desk and put a twenty-dollar bill between its leaves, at the eleventh
      chapter of Job, and closed it again. I talked with him for an hour or so,
      and asked, when I was leaving, if he had read the Book of Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not sence I was a boy,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read the eleventh chapter before you go to bed,&rdquo; I suggested, and went
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he came to my office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're off this evenin', with all our tools and implements,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If
      it hadn't been for you an' Job we couldn't have got away. You're a strong
      pair. I read in that chapter, 'Thou shalt forget thy misery and remember
      it as waters that pass away.' It was the very sermon I needed. My misery
      is gone. We have given you a vote o' thanks. It was hearty an' unanimous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was to take the freight and accommodation which left Heartsdale about
      eleven o'clock. He did not tell me his destination, but said that I should
      hear from him by-and-by. I went to the depot with Pearl and Barker, and
      saw them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I passed the house of the postmaster on my way home, a man in a tall
      beaver hat came out of its front door and walked hurriedly to a carriage
      and drove away. It was a cool night in November, and the collar of his
      overcoat was up around his ears. Something familiar in the step of the man
      caused me to turn and look at him and remember the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three evenings later M. F. was with me on the wire of the hill circuit,
      deserted by all save us, and I was taking my part in this dialogue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have important news,&rdquo; said Jo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father has had a letter from the postmaster of Heartsdale about Mr.
      Squares. The letter says that he is a man of good character and excellent
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw, then, that mine was a rival who had the will and cunning to win his
      point. It was strange that I had failed to recognize that swagger of his
      when I had seen him walk to his carriage the night I passed the
      postmaster's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's enough to make lightning laugh,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Your father told him what
      he was going to do, and Bony drove to Heartsdale on Tuesday night and made
      friends with the postmaster. He came late in the evening and did not
      intend to be observed, but I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too bad,&rdquo; she clicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can bear it as long as you think well of me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Suppose I go to
      Merrifield and have a talk with your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now; there's time enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there isn't! You seem to forget that I'm getting along in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy!&mdash;you're almost eighteen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm older than most gentlemen of twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can't you wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have something to tell you,&rdquo; I wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and it's too sacred for the wires. I must look into your eyes and
      hear your answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what it can be,&rdquo; the receiver clicked. &ldquo;I shall let you come as
      soon as I can. I want to see you very, very much. Good-night. Father has
      come for me. We are going to Washington in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment I caught the first words of a thrilling message on the main
      line. It said: &ldquo;Fort Sumter has been fired upon. It is the beginning of
      war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took the news to my mother, and declared my wish to go and fight for the
      North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;your father gave his life in the war with Mexico. Now my
      health is gone and you are all that's left to us. You are enlisted in a
      war with Poverty, and I can't spare you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her arms around me and cried, and I promised to stay at home, if
      possible, and it seemed a hard fate in spite of my happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote a long letter to the Colonel and confessed my love for his
      daughter, and begged him not to think ill of me without full information
      as to my character, and referred him to a number of good people.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brief and suggestive letter came promptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir,&mdash;As to your character, I have had all the information I
      desire. I should think better of it if you were to cease communicating
      with my daughter against my wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It hurt like the blow of a hammer, and I could not think of the Colonel
      with any degree of charity for a week or more, but, after all, it helped
      to make a man of me. In the heat of such days a man shapes his character&mdash;as
      the smith his iron that is hot from the forge&mdash;and tempers it in cool
      reflection. Soon I got a letter from Sam that told of the departure of Jo
      and the Colonel for Washington.

    <p>
      CTOBER had returned, and a letter had come from my friend McCarthy, asking
      me to visit him. My sister had learned telegraphy at home, and could take
      and send well enough to do my work at the office. It was arranged,
      therefore, that she and my mother should close the Mill House and come to
      town for a week or two, so that she could take my place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand-made gentleman had built his factory in the thriving town of
      Rushwater, on the Central Railroad. It took a long summer day to get
      there, for the engine was fed with wood, and we had now and then to load
      the tender with fuel, corded on the right of way, or drive cattle from the
      track or water the locomotive or mend a coupling, and had to wait at the
      junction for trains in equally bad luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the evening I found my friend McCarthy at the leading hotel in
      Rushwater, where he boarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleased to see you,&rdquo; he said, with dignity, as he shook my hand. &ldquo;Have
      you been to supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any kind of refreshment I can offer you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing except your company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took me to the desk and introduced me as his friend, &ldquo;Jacob Ezra Heron,
      Esq., a gentleman from St. Lawrence County.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give Mr. Heron the best the house affords, and put it on my bill,&rdquo; he
      added. I protested, whereupon he touched my arm and said: &ldquo;You will find,
      sir, that nobody will take your money in this town. If you will walk with
      me, I will show you my factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked for my friend Pearl, and McCarthy said that Pearl and Barker were
      in New York, and were coming to Rushwater in a day or two. The inventor
      had worked awhile in the shop, and planned a lot of machines which had
      hastened the process of manufacture. In June he had drawn his pay and left
      suddenly for parts unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that he went to the war,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy; &ldquo;but he never let
      on. Said he'd turn up here one of these days, and last week I got a long
      letter from the old man. Said he'd been sick, and was ready to come back
      to the shop if I wanted him. Of course, I said come on. We made our way
      through dark streets and stopped in front of a building&mdash;large for
      that day and country&mdash;on the river shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; he remarked, as we gazed for half a moment at the dim
      outlines of his building. &ldquo;I am the most extensive shipper of small
      freight on the railroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We entered the building, and he led me to his office and lighted a lamp.
      It was a large room, elegantly furnished. The chairs and table were made
      of mahogany and a soft carpet covered the floor. A large portrait of
      Napoleon Bonaparte hung on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those days the face and story of &ldquo;The Little Corporal&rdquo; were a power in the
      land, and not the most wholesome one, I have thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is grand,&rdquo; was my remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am making money,&rdquo; said the hand-made gentleman, &ldquo;and I propose to look
      as prosperous as I am. Sal is now the smallest part of my business. I
      spend twenty thousand a year advertising. My harp has four strings and one
      tune. Here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand-made gentleman began to read from a newspaper as follows:
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;SPEAKING OF SAL
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sal is willing; Sal can make the house shine; Sal is a worker&mdash;never
      cross and tired; the best and cheapest hired girl in the country. Cleans
      silver, glass, metal, and woodwork. Give Sal a chance.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;SAL'S SISTERS
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are three of them: Sally, the Brick, who cleans knives, forks,
      pots, and kettles; Sal's Sister, a wonderful laundry soap; also Salome, a
      clover-scented soap for the toilet. You will find them in all groceries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I began little&mdash;put it in a paper of five thousand circulation. I
      found that every dollar that I invested brought me four dollars and
      thirty-four and a half cents. The second ad. brought me four dollars and
      thirty-seven cents; the third four dollars and forty-one, and so it grew.
      I tried all the leading papers, and got the rate of profit and learned the
      exact value of repetition for each. The return increased as my goods
      travelled, and people began to talk about 'em. You see, I make something
      that the people want, and my first problem was to let them know it. That
      was easy. My next problem was to manufacture within a certain limit of
      cost. In that Pearl has helped. My next problem was to deliver the goods,
      and that is the greatest problem of all. The railroads are slow and
      unreliable. They have no more system than a carrier-pigeon. Y our freight
      is transferred until the boxes are worn out; it is side-tracked and lost
      and forgotten. You see, there are eleven railroads between here and
      Buffalo. They have been consolidated, but not harmonized. They are like
      eleven horses in the hands of a poor teamster; they don't pull together.
      They waste their strength. I complained to Mr. Dean Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said to me, 'We're doing our best, and if you want a better service
      you'll have to show us how to give it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave him a few ideas, and he liked 'em, and what do you suppose
      happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCarthy paused, but I could only shake my head and await his
      revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, one day the manager called and said the Chairman of the Executive
      Committee would like to see me,&rdquo; Mr. McCarthy went on. &ldquo;I pulled up my
      check-rein a little and went to Albany. It surprised him to see how young
      I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why,' said he, 'you're nothing but a boy!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'm twenty-three,' I said, 'but they count double. I've done two years'
      work in every one that I've lived.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me to dinner; it was grand. I didn't dare eat much&mdash;just
      sat and talked and listened and saw how they behaved themselves at his
      table. I learnt a number of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep my knife away from my face, for one thing,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Then a
      gentleman eats very slowly while he indulges in conversation. He's got to
      be able to talk about Brignoli and Madame Piccolomini&mdash;ain't that a
      grand name?&mdash;and Mrs. Siddons and Lester Wallack, with a word once in
      a while about the Missouri Compromise. When he gets through he washes the
      tips of his fingers. One of them told a vulgar story, and it seemed to me
      that we needed a bath for our minds as well as for our fingers. The
      chairman liked me, I guess, for he offered me some of his stock at a low
      price, and said they wanted me on the directory. I went in, and now I'm
      looking into the whole railroad problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to unroll a great map which he had been making, and which lay on
      a broad table. It was sixty feet long, and showed a section of the country
      some two hundred miles wide from Boston to Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't bother you with details,&rdquo; he 'said, &ldquo;but I have a great plan. It
      will narrow this space between New York and Chicago. It will build up a
      chain of great cities. It will make a market for goods and quicken their
      delivery. It will furnish a model for the development of other parts of
      the republic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the young man glowed with enthusiasm. Then he shook with
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's pretty good for the boy with a wooden leg that you met on the road
      to Canaan, isn't it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You see, the hand-made gentleman is
      getting along. He's took his mind off himself&mdash;partly&mdash;and put
      it on to other things. I don't need so much looking after as I did. I can
      talk pretty well, and know how to conduct myself in any company. Ye see,
      practice makes perfect, and I've practised decency for a long time. It's
      like breathing. Of course, I might be better inside, but outside I'll do
      for the time being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to hear more of your plan,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's this, in a nutshell,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I want to combine all the railroads
      between Boston, New York, and Chicago in one system. Now, if you're going
      from New York to Chicago, you change at Albany and stay all night; you
      change again at Syracuse and stay all night, and again at Buffalo, and so
      on. Of course, you can ride all night, but it wears you out. I want a
      better road-bed and heavier rails and lighter cars and bigger engines and
      more power to handle 'em, and a continuous trip. Why shouldn't we travel
      nights with comfort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand-made gentleman strode up and down the room and gestured like a
      man making a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five men have twenty times the power of one. Did you ever think of that?&rdquo;
       he asked. &ldquo;When you put two and two together you get about sixteen, but
      they've got to be one before they can be sixteen. That suggests the value
      of combination.&rdquo; He paused before me, and added: &ldquo;Here's the trouble. The
      idea is bigger'n I am. There's only one man in the world who can carry it
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanderbilt,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There's the biggest man in the country. He's made
      twenty million dollars with his brain. Think of that! He's the Napoleon of
      this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There came a rap at the door, and Mr. McCarthy shouted, &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; and a
      young man entered with a large blank-book in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Heron, this is Mr. Magillies, a graduate of the commercial college at
      Poughkeepsie, and a grand penman,&rdquo; said the hand-made gentleman. &ldquo;He takes
      down my letters for me, and writes 'em off and sees that they're worded
      proper. Would you like to hear me answer my correspondence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured him of my interest, and thereupon the hand-made gentleman
      dictated many letters with a look and tone of great dignity. Now and then
      he addressed some delinquent and unscrupulous debtor with great emphasis,
      and more than once he described the virtues of Sal and Sal's sisters and
      the clover-scented soap loudly and with gestures suited to the word, so
      that he reminded me of the picture in my reading-book of a Roman senator
      addressing the populace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man left us late in the evening with his record of their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said the hand-made gentleman: &ldquo;I must have somebody for that position
      who is more than a mere writing-machine. I want some gentleman who thinks
      as I do and will stand up for me like a brother. I want you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took me by surprise, and I thanked him and expressed doubt of my
      fitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you, and you know me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I like you, Mr. Heron, and
      believe in you; and if you feel the same, let's pull together. I have some
      big things to do, and you can help me; and I'll double the pay you're
      getting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was a rapid writer, and many had praised the neatness and legibility of
      my penmanship. Then, too, I was rather fond of the hand-made gentleman,
      and had a great faith in him. But how about my mother and sister and Jo,
      for both Heartsdale and Merrifield were a long way from Rushwater.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to go to the war,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;if my mother will consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ambition is meritorious,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There can be nothing nobler than
      the wish to serve your country, but I don't think it needs you. The war
      will be over in a few weeks. Then there are your mother and sister&mdash;don't
      they need you more than the country does?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you mustn't think of going. Your father gave his life in battle. I
      think your mother has given the country enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I walked up and down the room thinking. &ldquo;It's hard work,&rdquo; said Mr.
      McCarthy. &ldquo;I sit here until midnight sometimes pounding at the letters.
      But you'll have a chance to travel and meet men who amount to something,
      and we'll have a good time together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only a matter of arranging my affairs,&rdquo; I said to him. &ldquo;There's my
      mother and sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home and see if you can get them to move here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lighted a long cigar, and sat down with one foot on the desk. The
      hand-made gentleman had learned to smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's another thing&mdash;I want to open my heart to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      haven't a brother or sister or friend that I can talk to about certain
      matters. The fact is, I'm in love and engaged to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and was smoking thoughtfully, as I asked, &ldquo;To Miss Fame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she didn't reciprocate; and maybe it's just as well. I am engaged to
      a talented actress by the name of Maud Isabel Manning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused again as if to note the effect of this impressive name, and
      continued: &ldquo;She's from New York, and beautiful as a dream. Came here with
      a show, and one morning she walked into the office. Told me that she used
      my toilet soap, and wanted to see the factory. I showed her about, and
      fell in love with her. She's a wonder&mdash;grand clothes, and knows how
      to wear 'em; wonderful education, fine talker, sings like a bird, and can
      make the piano roar. I told her about my false leg and foot and my family&mdash;that's
      worse than a wooden leg&mdash;but she doesn't mind, and we're going to be
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fear that I shared the prejudice of my Puritan fathers against the
      stage, and was a little taken aback and a bit conservative in my comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think he felt it, for he blushed and began to argue, although a little
      off the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think every gentleman ought to marry. There's something about women
      that makes a man gentle. Old bachelors are about as ugly as a bear with a
      sore head. I want somebody to work for besides myself. I can't love myself
      well enough to pay for the struggle. I've got to have somebody who grows
      happy as I grow rich, or I wouldn't care for money, upon my word I
      wouldn't. Then the Bible says that men should increase and multiply and
      replenish the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wished him all happiness, and tried to put his mind at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am forgetting you in talking of myself&mdash;you will want to retire,&rdquo;
       he said, and we closed the office and walked to the inn together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning some one rapped at my bedroom door. &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; I
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend and fellow-citizen from St. Lawrence County,&rdquo; was the answer,
      and I knew it was Pearl.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened the door, and there stood my old friend in the familiar goggles
      and linen duster, but with his left sleeve empty and a new scar on the
      side of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Pearl!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;what's happened to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've just been trimmed up a little,&rdquo; he said, with a smile, as he
      gave me his hand. &ldquo;It's nothing. Every tree needs it once in a while. I
      had too much wood for my sap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An accident?&rdquo; I asked, with tears in my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An accident, an' I'm tryin' to forget it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;How are the folks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I saw clearly that he wished me to say no more of his misfortunes.
      Soon Mr. McCarthy came, and he and the Pearl went to the shop together.

      FTER breakfast I found the handmade gentleman at his factory, and went
      with him into all its departments, and saw a hundred men and women at
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to go and ride behind my trotter with me,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy,
      presently. &ldquo;Every gentleman has a trotter these days, and bets a little
      money on him once in a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand-made gentleman lived at an inn not far from Saratoga, and one
      could not even enter it without getting a touch of the gay spirit of the
      summer capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we opened the shop door a drunken wretch in dirty clothing sat on the
      porch. He rose, clinging to a column, and asked for a dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, uncle, back again, eh?&rdquo; said the handmade gentleman. &ldquo;No more
      to-day&mdash;no more to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a kindly tone, and said to me, as he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it's a disgrace, but I can't help it; and maybe he can't. He's my
      uncle, and very fond o' me, after all. Followed me down here. Has a spree
      every little while, and spends all he has earned in a day or two. If I
      don't give him money he curses me, and goes about the place and runs me
      down, and does all he can to make me ashamed o' myself. Many a time I've
      felt like shooting him, but by-and-by I forgive the poor man and lift him
      out o' the gutter and buy him new clothes and set him to work again. And,
      do you know, he's been a great help to me, as ye might say? Lord
      Chesterfield says that a gentleman should forgive injuries, and I guess
      it's so. He's given me practice in the art of forgiving. It's done me
      good. I kind o' think, sometimes, that when you help another fellow to get
      on his feet you do more for yourself than ye do for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His trotter, hitched to a light buggy, was waiting at the door of the inn,
      and we drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a daughter of one of the Morgans,&rdquo; he said, as the mare began to
      show her stride. &ldquo;They're breeding for less weight and more power and
      quicker action. It's a tendency of the times. Foot and wheel are beginning
      to move faster. Everybody is tired of going slow. Mr. Bonner says that
      he'll show us a horse by-and-by that can trot in 2.15.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a funny thing,&rdquo; he added, after a moment's pause; &ldquo;my factory kind
      o' sets the pace for this town. It starts the day and ends it. My whistle
      sends every one to work, and tells 'em when to knock off, in and out o'
      the shop. When it sounds in the morning you'll see men who started a
      little late running to get to their jobs. It's brought new ideas and
      business methods and a quicker step into the old town.&rdquo; The hand-made
      gentleman took me to my train soon after dinner. Pearl was there to see me
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you're comin' here, Jake,&rdquo; he said, as he shook my hand. &ldquo;You've
      always been a great help to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how,&rdquo; was my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've helped me to live,&rdquo; he said, with a sober look. &ldquo;As soon as you
      get back you and McCarthy will go down and see Vanderbilt. I've got it all
      arranged. The medals helped me. It's the only time I ever used 'em. They
      landed me in the Commodore's office, and I had a talk with him straight
      from the shoulder. Told him if he went into the transatlantic ferry
      business he'd lose every dollar he had, as Collins had done. He wanted to
      know what made me think so, an' I told him that he couldn't compete with
      the English, who had been doing that job for centuries with cheaper labor
      than we could hire. I explained to him that the business was a growth and
      not a product; that one might as well try to compete with the forest by
      planting trees. He agreed with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Heartsdale I found my sister in love with her work, and had a talk with
      the superintendent in Montreal, who promised to retain her. That evening,
      as we sat by the fire at home, I got a view of myself that was quite new
      to me. For a time it filled me with bitterness, but taught me what I had
      to know, and set me forward in the race a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Report of my adventure on the back of the rope-walker had got to
      Heartsdale&mdash;to this day I know not how, although I suspected Bony. It
      had set idle tongues wagging. A letter to my sister, from one of her
      friends on a far side of the county, told how she had heard the story,
      and, of course, I confessed the truth. The harm it did lay in this: It
      singled me out and stood me up for scrutiny. Follies which would have been
      forgotten were enlarged and raked together and made to shine forth. The
      undertaker and the carver of epitaphs had marked me for execution, and,
      assisted by the Heartsdale Comet Band, had made hopeful progress. They had
      travelled far, and everywhere people had wished to know about me, and I
      had been well set off as a conceited, dare-devil sort of a ne'er-do-well
      who had been concerned in the smuggling business.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to understand why Colonel Busby thought so ill of me, and there
      was only one way to correct his opinion, and my mother made that clear. I
      must needs go to work and make a character for myself and show it in my
      conduct&mdash;as the hand-made gentleman had done. My way would not be
      quite like his, but I must be hand-made and upon honor, as he put it. The
      ready-made article had not stood the wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you had better put the pretty girl out of your head for a while,&rdquo;
       said my mother. &ldquo;You can keep her in your heart, and that will give you
      something to work for. But you mustn't give your brain to her. You've got
      to make a man of yourself, and you need your brain for your work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose she marries somebody else,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you should not be sorry, because if she loves you she will wait for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That seemed like rather cold philosophy. Its power over me grew as I
      thought of it, however, and by-and-by it began to have a sustaining force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could go to the war,&rdquo; I remarked, with a sigh, for I longed to
      be a hero and show my courage, as my father had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a wicked business,&rdquo; said my mother, sadly. &ldquo;I hoped that you would
      never want to go. I think it would be wise for you to go with Mr.
      McCarthy. He is fond of you and has good principles, and I presume it is
      best for you to leave this town; but I can't spare you for the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told them all about my visit to the handmade gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he as homely as ever?&rdquo; my sister asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he has grown good-looking,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;He is going to be married.&rdquo;
       And I told of his engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My land! I wouldn't marry him if he were the last man in the world!&rdquo;
       Sarah exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; was my query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked and talked so funny&mdash;just like a young old man. Then he
      was so afraid of me&mdash;hardly dared to look me in the face. I don't see
      how he had the courage to ask her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume she furnished all the courage that was necessary. But you'd be
      surprised to see him. He's handsome, and can walk as well as anybody; and
      I believe he's going to be a great man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure I wish him well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pearl says that he is a born leader&mdash;that the new spirit is in him.
      I think that girl is lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that you will stick to him,&rdquo; said my mother. &ldquo;You see I have a new
      motto on the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It occupied a prominent place above the mantel&mdash;a yard of wisdom in
      letters of red silk:
    </p>
    <h3>
      <i>STICK TO NOTHING AND NOTHING WILL STICK TO YOU</i>
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was rather good counsel for a boy, and, in truth, I had begun to share
      the uneasiness which, beyond doubt, had inspired this gentle reproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you thought of that motto, for I want you to stick to me,&rdquo; I
      suggested. &ldquo;Mr. Pearl says that as soon as I get my hand in you should
      come and live with me, both of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Pearl is a mystery,&rdquo; said my mother. &ldquo;Sometimes I think I have seen
      him before, but I cannot place him. The goggles cover his eyes so, and I
      have heard his voice but once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gathered all my clothing and treasures and packed them into my trunk,
      and when we were ready to go to bed my mother gave me the horruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One night I found you asleep in your chair,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and the horruck
      lay beside you. I saw it was robbing you of rest, and so I put it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horruck!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;What can it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your teacher put the coin in your pocket that day before Christmas, years
      ago. It is one of a number of silver pieces that were marked by an old and
      kindly man who lived in Hearts-dale years ago. They taught his religion,
      and he used to slip them into the pockets of needy people, who wondered
      where they came from. We used to call them the ghost riddles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night I solved the riddle of the horruck by writing down the alphabet
      and discarding <i>x</i> and choosing letters to the right and left of <i>m</i>,
      the middle letter. So I got this message:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Love is the key of heaven.
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      I love you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It made me know that Jo loved me, and I went to bed happier than I had
      ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my last night in the Mill House for many a long year. The cry of
      the wind in the chimney and the sound of the falling water put a new
      prayer in my heart and a solemn sense of the dearness of my old home, not
      to be lost in care and toil, in pleasures and palaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day I returned the horruck to Jo, so as to let her know, plainly,
      that I loved her also.

    <p>
      GOT to Rushwater late at night, and reported at eight next morning at the
      factory office. Mr. McCarthy had not arrived, and I went down to Pearl's
      shop in the y friend sat by a lathe. He rose and embraced me with his one
      arm. Near us a carpenter was working at a long bench. The Pearl put on an
      apron and began to heat up his forge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you getting along here?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised at my success,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have made myself the most
      hated man in Rushwater. I am abhorred, hissed at, despised. I deprive
      honest labor of its occupation and grind the faces o' the poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have invented a machine that does the work of ten men, and does
      it better than they did. Now, the ten had to find other jobs, and they
      didn't like it. Did you ever pull a hen off her perch late in the evening?
      You know what a noise it makes&mdash;all the others get scairt an' begin
      to holler. Well, you pull a man off his perch and you get the same sort of
      a ruction. I happen to be the leg-grabber. I didn't mean to do any harm.
      The purpose o' the factory is to make the goods as cheap as possible, and
      I was employed to help solve the problem. I've got our wheels on the main
      shaft, and God's draft-horse is whirlin' 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took me into the sub-cellar, where a rush of water struck the buckets
      of a turbine and made it shriek as it sped on its pivot, and the power of
      a hundred horses went up the shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon a boy came down to find me, and said that Mr. McCarthy had arrived. I
      went to the office at once, and within half an hour had begun my new work.
      The hand-made gentleman had secured for me a copy of Isaac Pitman's
      treatise, and I spent all my leisure in the acquisition of &ldquo;soundhand,&rdquo; or
      shorthand, as we now call it. I enjoyed my work, and saw at once that I
      was likely to do some good in it. Mr. McCarthy wished me to spend a few
      months in a business college, as much in his interest as my own, he said
      to me, and in New York he made arrangements to that end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to get the pace of the city,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;and learn how to
      score up in proper style. There's a lot of very polished people down here.
      See how they dress and behave themselves morning, noon, and night. It will
      be a help to both of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went to the big city that week, I to begin my studies, and he to have a
      talk with the great Mr. Vanderbilt. The Pearl had said to the hand-made
      gentleman, when we were leaving Rush water:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let him scare you. He's as full o' power as my turbine; has a good
      deal of a whir to him. Likes resistance; so does every great force. Used
      to row a boat all day, an' every day. Fought the wind an' the tide.
      Stiffened his hands on the oar. Can't straighten 'em to this day. He's
      fought a thousand difficulties. He'll take you for another an' pitch into
      ye&mdash;like as not. Don't let him scare ye. If he jumps on ye, jump on
      him; he'll enjoy it, an' begin to respect ye. It's like puttin' a belt on
      the turbine&mdash;you'll take off a bit of his power an' ease him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We passed through two offices on our way to that of the Commodore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walk right in,&rdquo; said a colored man, who sat near an open door, when Mr.
      McCarthy had claimed his right to an interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      We entered, and saw a large, handsome man sitting by a desk on the farther
      side of a big room. He had a massive head, and white hair and
      side-whiskers&mdash;the latter neatly trimmed&mdash;and sat with legs
      crossed in a big arm-chair. The elegance of his attire impressed me,
      especially the waistcoat of figured silk, the jewel in his shirt-front,
      and the spotless white choker. He looked up over his glasses. The skin
      began to wrinkle a bit around his dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it, sonny?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is James Henry McCarthy, of Rush-water, New York,&rdquo; said my
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what your name is; tell me your business,&rdquo; said Commodore
      Vanderbilt&mdash;for he it was&mdash;and he spoke sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a railroad project, referred to by my friend, H. M. Pearl, Esq., in
      his talk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said Mr. Vanderbilt, as he flung a paper on the desk before him.
      &ldquo;I've got projects enough now. Will you please let me alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will not,&rdquo; said the hand-made gentleman, decisively. &ldquo;I've
      travelled over two hundred miles to keep an appointment with you, and I
      insist that you show me proper respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Commodore changed his tone. &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I won't talk with
      you; I can't talk with you. Come to my house to-night. I'll see you at
      half-past seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the hand-made gentleman as we left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCarthy's feelings had been hurt and his confidence began to leave
      him. He had gone there with a good deal of honest pride in his heart&mdash;perhaps,
      even, a little too much&mdash;and I think he would rather I had not seen
      his embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised,&rdquo; he said to me as we were going down the stairs together.
      &ldquo;He cannot have read the letters of Lord Chesterfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn't had time, probably,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our inn was near, and no word passed between us after that until we got to
      our room. My friend strode the floor in silence, and tears stood in his
      eyes for a moment. I felt for him, but could think of nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think one gentleman ought to be careful of the feelings of another,&rdquo;
       said Mr. McCarthy. &ldquo;He made me feel like a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was out of sorts,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have learned this,&rdquo; said the hand-made gentleman: &ldquo;business is war. I
      see it clearer every day. If you want respect you've got to fight for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We recovered our composure by-and-by, and spent the rest of the day among
      tradesmen extending the acquaintance of Sal and the sisters of Sal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past seven we presented ourselves at the house of the Commodore at
      10 Washington Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCarthy carried his map under his arm, and it was about half the
      diameter of a piece of stove-pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant showed us into a large parlor. We could see Mr. Vanderbilt in a
      room back of it, sitting by a table in his shirt-sleeves reading a
      newspaper. We observed him fearfully as he took our cards from the tray&mdash;plain
      written cards they were, save that Mr. McCarthy's had a bird on it, drawn
      by his secretary. He flung his paper aside and rose&mdash;a splendid
      figure of a man, full chest, broad shoulders, and the six feet of him
      straight as an arrow&mdash;and came slowly into the parlor where we sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sonny, what can I do for you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a map to show you,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; was the sharp query of the Commodore.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend began to unroll his map, and said, &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steamboat king was impatient. A sharp exclamation shot from his lips,
      like the toot of a warning whistle, and he added: &ldquo;It's bigger'n a
      bill-board. Unfurl it on the floor there. Run it down into the back
      parlor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Mr. McCarthy had spread his map and begun talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's Albany,&rdquo; he said, pointing with his cane. &ldquo;Here's eleven railroads
      reaching west to Buffalo, called the Central System. Here are others that
      go on to Chicago and others that run east to Boston. Here is the steamer
      line from New York to Albany, closed half the year. Here are two lines of
      railroad that run north from New York to the capital&mdash;the Harlem and
      the Hudson River. The Harlem road can be bought for less than six cents on
      the dollar. I want you to buy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do I want of it?&rdquo; the Commodore demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the key o' the future, and you need it,&rdquo; said McCarthy. &ldquo;It's the
      beginning of a great plan. First buy the Harlem, and then buy the Hudson
      River road. And do you not see that all these railroads that run east and
      west up here can't reach the metropolis without your help&mdash;especially
      in the winter when the steamers are out of business? Did you ever see a
      small boy lead a big bull? It's surprising how easy he does it when he has
      a ring in the bull's nose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remembered the bull at Baker's, and felt the truth of his remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commodore was now leaning over the map and looking down upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These two railroads will give you command of the whole situation,&rdquo; my
      friend continued, &ldquo;and that's important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCarthy paused for half a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, go on,&rdquo; said the Commodore; &ldquo;let's have your argument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can whip 'em all into one system, from New York and Boston to
      Chicago. You can give us a continuous trip between these cities. You can
      run freight to any point in the system without rehandling on through cars,
      to pay each railroad according to the mileage it supplies. You would make
      it possible for me to sell my goods in Chicago and other distant cities
      and deliver 'em on time. You would quicken the pace of business. Every
      factory on the line would double its output in two years. It means growth
      and a new republic and a string of great cities, and a stream of traffic
      flowing east and west like a river. There are not so many tons in the St.
      Lawrence as your wheels would carry, and they would roll on like the
      waterfloods, never stopping. They would enrich you beyond the dreams of
      avarice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand-made gentleman saw the truth clearly, and flashed the torch of
      his enthusiasm on all sides of it. He shook his cane over the map; his
      eyes glowed like a prophet's. After all this time, I can but dimly suggest
      the quaint dignity and the singular power of his appeal. I felt it, and
      have tried to remember all, since these years have complimented his
      insight by making history of his dreams. I recall how his ardor thrilled
      me, and how the Commodore rose from his knee and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the dreams of avarice do not bother <i>me</i>. I
      have money enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of his voice made it clear to me, even, that Mr. McCarthy's talk
      had impressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the hand-made gentleman; &ldquo;but you have power, composed of
      brains, money, and public confidence. You're the only man who can do this
      thing, and it ought to be done. You <i>must</i> do it for the sake of the
      country. Patriotism, and not avarice, will inspire you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Commodore smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy, how old are you?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;Twenty-three years; but they count
      double.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me you've made some money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm getting along very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man about thirty years of age had just entered the room. Mr. Vanderbilt
      turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to come over and keep my books,&rdquo; he said, brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, uncle, I'm not a bookkeeper,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I don't know
      how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know enough to take the money that comes in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And add up the expenses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And give me the difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's all I want, and any d&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; fool could do
      that. You may begin Monday. Goodnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thoughts of the Commodore went straight to their mark and his words
      followed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his right hand on the arm of Mr. McCarthy. I saw then how the grip
      of the oar had stiffened his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man, I'll think it over,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You go home and don't talk too
      much. What ye don't say will never do any harm. I make it a rule of my
      life never to talk of anything I'm going to do until I've done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We left the house and walked slowly in the direction of Broadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll do it,&rdquo; said the hand-made gentleman. &ldquo;He caught my point on the
      fly. His brain is quick as lightning, and he had the whole thing in a
      second. He let me go on to make sure that I knew what I was talking
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose he does what you want him to, how are you going to make by it?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll trust him for that,&rdquo; said Mr. McCarthy. &ldquo;However, I can take care o'
      myself. As soon as he makes a move I'll buy stock, that's what I'll do.
      James Henry McCarthy will not be left behind.&rdquo; After a moment's
      reflection, he added: &ldquo;I'm surprised at one thing: he swears like a
      trooper. And did you see that he came out in a pair of carpet slippers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would have shocked Lord Chesterfield,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCarthy went on. &ldquo;A gentleman ought to be more careful.&rdquo; He stopped
      presently and gave me his hand, saying: &ldquo;I'm going to see Miss Manning;
      she's the dearest girl in all the world. Leaves on a long tour to-morrow,
      and I shall spend a week with her on the road. It doesn't seem right for
      her to be travelling unattended. I want her to be a lady. Perhaps I shall
      hire some woman to go with her.&rdquo;

    <p>
      CONTINUED my studies in New York for a year and a half. My growth, like
      McCarthy's, had been forced a little by the pressure of hard experience,
      and I was more serious and more thoughtful and observing, possibly, than
      boys of my age were apt to be. When I returned to Rushwater I had some
      knowledge of banking and bookkeeping, and the power and purpose of
      corporations, and, indeed, of the whole theory of business&mdash;not so
      much as I thought I had, of course, for no man has struck the right
      balance in the big ledger of his own mind until it is nearly full. He is
      so apt to overcredit himself and forget some of the charges. Well, in
      spite of that, I had things on the right side, and, among other items, my
      phonography, for my hand could follow the tongues of the orators, and that
      was a pace for you! Those days New York was full of prophets. I went to
      hear them for the sake of practice, and gathered reams of florid
      eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is curious how I clung to that boy love in my heart. My sister had gone
      to Merrifield to visit a school friend, and met Jo, since when they had
      written letters to each other. So all my best news came roundabout, and
      was never too much, but always enough to sustain my passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were perils in the big city for one of my age without a home, but
      this thing in my heart gave me good counsel. Whatever others may have
      thought of her, to me she was like Pallas to the Greek&mdash;a divinity&mdash;and
      I had to be worthy of her. I had met good people, and seen a bit of the
      best life of the city through my mother's uncle, Mr. Schermerhorn, and
      gathered knowledge of the amenities for my friend McCarthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again I had seen Mr. Vanderbilt when his famous Mountain Gal was to
      race near Coney Island. I took the horse-cars in Brooklyn, and went as far
      as they would carry me on my way to the track, and tramped down the road
      while others raced along in every kind of vehicle. It was after the hour,
      and the crowd had passed me, and I had not far to go, when along came the
      Commodore in his gig. I raised my hat to him, and he pulled up beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a ride, boy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him and got in, and away we sped. &ldquo;Going to the race?&rdquo; he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I want to see your horse go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You remember the big map?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see you was somebody I knew. Great boy&mdash;that young Irishman.
      He'll make his mark. Have you a ticket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; I'll fix it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I entered with him in his gig, and he took me to the club-house and
      found a seat for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day I returned to my home in Hearts-dale, and hoped while there to go
      to Merrifield and see the Colonel and Jo. I was much taken down to learn
      from my sister that they had sailed for Liverpool the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was ready for my career at Rushwater, and my mother and sister were
      going to live with me in a snug house which the hand-made gentleman had
      built and furnished for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I called upon Judge Crocket and presented my compliments. Mr. Boggs and
      the soldiers were playing old sledge in a corner. All eyes were turned
      upon me. The Judge asked how I was getting along, and greeted my answer
      with a little smile of incredulity. His smiles at time had the gleam of
      steel and cut like a chisel; but I wanted to make friends, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought it over, and made up my mind that you were very kind to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you have!&rdquo; he answered, as if caring little what I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I had meant to be polite, but his indifference stung me, and I added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you sent me out of bad business and worse company. I am grateful.
      You men who live in the shadow of death don't know how pleasant the world
      is. I want to thank you.&rdquo; Judge Crocket began to carve the air with his
      chisel. &ldquo;You're a scamp, sir,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;You wrote that 'scurrilious'
      poem about the dance at Jones'. It was an outrage&mdash;an outrage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deserve no such credit,&rdquo; was my answer. &ldquo;I did not write the poem, and,
      if it hurt your feelings, I am glad that I know nothing of its authorship.
      But you have no right to complain. For years you have been cutting people
      to the bone with sharp criticism. You seem to think well of no one. You
      have said things about me that were undeserved and scandalous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge had resumed his cutting, and the wrinkles in his face had
      deepened, but he made no answer. Mr. Boggs nudged his neighbor and looked
      up at me with a smile, in which amusement was mingled with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left the shop, and found Swipes and some of our old companions waiting
      for me outside the door. Swipes had grown so that I scarcely knew him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you and the shingle-nail?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nail an' I have gone out of partnership,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I don't worry
      any more about that nail. I used to lie awake nights thinking of it.
      By-and-by I forgot it, and was all right. I drawed the nail out o' my
      mind, as ye might say, and have had no more trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swipes had gone into deeper water than he knew. From that moment I began
      to draw the shingle-nails out of my own mind; the opposition of Boggs and
      Crocket was, after all, a little matter. What kind of man was I in <i>fact?</i>&mdash;there
      was the important thing, not what they thought of me. Death and his angels
      were ever striving to pull one down. I would not let them halt or baffle
      me for a moment. I had my belt on the great engine of life, as Pearl had
      told me, and I knew it would whirl me on.
    </p>
    <p>
      So from that day I permitted little things to worry me no longer, but gave
      my strength wholly to greater issues. I forgot the shingle-nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys had heard of my adventure on the high rope, and now regarded me
      with a kind of awe, and put many queries. I answered them with a sense of
      sadness and humility that there was nothing else in my career which they
      thought it worth while to ask about.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, I was not sorry to leave the village of Heartsdale. It was
      greatly changed. The burned area was pretty well covered with new
      buildings. One man had left a black, dirty, charred ruin flush with the
      sidewalk in the very centre of the main street, and refused either to
      remove it or permit it to be removed. He blamed the firemen and the pump
      and everybody in the village for the loss of his store, and there stood
      the ruin for a punishment&mdash;a black memorial of his blacker scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      New faces were on every side. A steam-mill had come, and morning, noon,
      and night one could hear the peal of its whistle. The first waves of power
      had reached the little town. Instead of being content with its small
      farmer-traffic, the town itself had become a producer, and was shipping
      doors and blinds and sashes, and boats and canoes, and rough and dressed
      lumber to distant places. A new act was beginning in the great drama of
      the republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we started for Rushwater there were at least a score of the friends
      and schoolmates of my sister who went to the station for a last word with
      us. There was not a prettier miss in the north country than that very
      sister of mine&mdash;save Jo, the incomparable Jo!
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand-made gentleman met us at the depot in Rushwater, and drove us to
      our new home with a fine coach and pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a change!&rdquo; said my sister, when he had left us for the night. &ldquo;He
      has grown positively handsome and is a real gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Success and observation and right thinking, above all, had distinguished
      the man&mdash;James Henry McCarthy. Something&mdash;was it the tireless
      upreach of his thought?&mdash;had straightened his figure and raised his
      chin a little, and covered him with a strong, calm dignity, as with a robe
      of higher office, and tuned his voice for new appeals, so that even I was
      surprised and got a little touch of awe, and felt my smallness when I took
      his hand. I spoke of these things and of my feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said my mother, &ldquo;the only real gentleman is 'hand-made,' as he
      puts it. After all, one cannot inherit much of that. One has to begin,
      soon or late, and build slowly and patiently, putting one stone on
      another, just as Mr. McCarthy has done.&rdquo;

    <p>
      ARLY next morning Mr. McCarthy came and took me for a drive. He was a new
      man, quiet, serious, and inclined to let me do the talking. I thought of
      him no more as the land-made gentleman. Just the one word was enough for
      him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something had gone wrong with him, and I wondered what it might be. I
      hoped he would speak of the love-affair. He put many questions, and said,
      by-and-by:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you've come, for the railroad work takes half my time, and poor
      Sal is neglected. I want you to tackle Sal. I'm going to organize a stock
      company for Sal, and make you president perhaps, and give all my time to
      larger things. The army of steam-power is going to need help at Albany,
      and I may try for a seat in the legislature. But you know Horace Bulger
      runs the county, and I won't buy honor. I've got to beat him. I thought it
      would be easy, with three hundred voters in my shop, but the first I knew
      Bulger had stirred them up. They're growling about our machines, and the
      trouble will last until convention time, you see. He did it to block my
      game. If I want to go I've got to settle with him.&rdquo; After a moment of
      silence, he added: &ldquo;There's a lot for you to do. I want you to begin by
      advertising the hygienic value of a bath every day. Keep dinging on the
      idea that soap and civilization go hand in hand. Let it be understood that
      a clean mind can only live in a clean body, that decency begins with soap.
      Let us assail the great army of the unwashed, and increase the respect of
      the people for Salome, the clover-scented sister of Sal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shop had doubled its size, and now covered half an acre of the river
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Pearl and Barker in a larger basement shop. The gray-haired man
      put his one arm around me and held me close for half a moment, and said
      not a word. Then he sat down and raised his goggles and wiped his eyes,
      and I remember that I felt a little ashamed of my own weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Barker!&rdquo; he called, when the goggles were in place again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barker took his stand in the old familiar attitude of receiver for the
      firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we say to the gentleman from New York, and late of St. Lawrence
      County?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog barked almost gleefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Mr. Barker. We are delighted to see him. We bid him
      welcome to the growing village of Rushwater. We do, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led me to the turbine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it runs smoother and makes less noise; it has got
      dignity; it knows how to handle its power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not help thinking that it was, in a way, like McCarthy himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I had no sooner entered the stirring life of the shop at Rushwater
      than things began to happen. One day Mr. Horace Bulger came into the
      office, where I sat alone with the gentleman. The power of Mr. Bulger was
      universally known and respected. He ran the politics of the county. For
      years no citizen within its boundaries had been elected to office without
      his consent. He was born poor; he had neither toiled nor spun; he never
      seemed to want anything for himself, but, somehow, Mr. Bulger had
      prospered, and very handsomely, as things went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to say to you,&rdquo; said Mr. Bulger, addressing the
      hand-made gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it,&rdquo; said the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it had better be confidential.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go right ahead. This young man is my private secretary, and knows all my
      business. If I should sell my soul, he'd have to know the price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bulger hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not need to say that your confidence will be respected by both of
      us,&rdquo; my friend added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. McCarthy,&rdquo; said the wily Bulger, as he dropped into a chair, &ldquo;I think
      you are likely to be nominated by the Republicans of our district for the
      Assembly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too confident, Mr. Bulger,&rdquo; said the hand-made gentleman. &ldquo;I will
      bet you three thousand dollars that I am not nominated and elected this
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those old models of gentlemanhood, after which Mr. McCarthy had fashioned
      himself, saw no harm in a wager.
    </p>
    <p>
      The politician thought a moment and smiled. Then said he:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take the bet, and am ready to post the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your check is good enough,&rdquo; Mr. McCarthy answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No checks,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Let's make it money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who shall be the stake-holder?&rdquo; was the inquiry of my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your secretary&mdash;if you will vouch for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd trust my life with him,&rdquo; said the handmade gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the money was put into my hands, to be deposited to my credit in Mr.
      Bulger's bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing I have to ask,&rdquo; Mr. McCarthy added: &ldquo;You know I have no
      secrets, and don't want any. I'm not ashamed of this bet, and I hope
      you're not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; said Mr. Bulger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right then; we've got nothing to cover up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! I want everything aboveboard. We can either of us tell the whole
      truth if it should seem necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Bulger had left us, I turned to my friend McCarthy and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're sure to be elected now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;But he's got some work on his
      hands. I cannot understand his coming here. To begin with, he'll have to
      settle that strike for me, and it may not be so easy. He's got to unravel
      a lot of his own knitting or pay the forfeit. I don't think he knows what
      it means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We both laughed for a moment, after which he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's his funeral&mdash;not mine. A gentleman can bet, but he could not
      make a bargain for a seat in the legislature, and it's undignified and
      immoral to pay for votes. Bulger has got to do the work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I regret sometimes that Mr. McCarthy had not then the surer light that
      came in due time. He was very human, so do not expect too much of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day our evening paper contained this announcement:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I understand,&rdquo; said the hand-made gentleman; &ldquo;Bulger was acting under
      orders when he came here to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that Vanderbilt controls the Republican party?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants honest and progressive men in the legislature, and has a hand in
      many a caucus,&rdquo; said McCarthy. &ldquo;He's got to do it or have a lot of pirates
      to reckon with when he goes up to Albany for the legislation he needs. Any
      man likely to block the wheels of progress is killed in the conventions,
      if not before. He's paving the way for a new era.&rdquo;

    <p>
      EARL had learned how to use and control the great draft-horse of the
      river. At a touch of his finger a belt moved, and up went the push of the
      falling waters into a thousand feet of shafting. Other levers could divide
      this stream of power into some forty currents guided by leathern belts to
      the labor-saving devices of my able friend. These latter had doubled the
      capacity of the shop without increasing its working force, and soon the
      machines which made &ldquo;Sal and Sal's Sisters&rdquo; began to be regarded as the
      rivals&mdash;and even as the enemies&mdash;of labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candidacy of Mr. McCarthy had been announced; the caucuses were coming
      on; no sign of opposition had developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning the gentleman came in with important news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will strike to-morrow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have learned the whole plot.
      Gaffney, that little red-headed Irishman who is the boss of the
      wrapping-room, is at the bottom of it. They had a secret session last
      night and made him spokesman. He will come here to-morrow morning and ask
      me to put out the machines. If I refuse, they will quit and fight me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat, thoughtfully, tapping with his pencil. In half a moment he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man Gaffney has quite a head on him. I think I'll promote the
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promote him!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I never discharge anybody. I promote people if it becomes necessary
      to get rid of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tapped his call-bell, and said to the errand boy, &ldquo;Ask Mr. Gaffney to
      come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaffney arrived presently, a bit embarrassed. &ldquo;Sit down a moment,&rdquo; said
      Mr. McCarthy. &ldquo;I said when you came here that I would keep an eye on you,
      and I've done it. I'm satisfied that you're too talented for your
      position. I'm going to send you to the shop in Troy, where our machines
      are made, and keep you there until you've learned all about them. Then
      I'll try you as superintendent, at a larger salary, and a 5-per-cent,
      interest in the profits. If you 'tend to business you'll make a fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaffney was dumb with surprise. His face turned red; his hands trembled;
      he voiced his gratitude in a stammered sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to do it,&rdquo; said McCarthy. &ldquo;Go back to your work, and be ready to
      leave Monday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gaffney retired, and my friend sent for another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a different kind of chap,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;He's a sore on
      the body of poor Sal, and we'll remove him by a gentle sort of surgery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His name was Hinkley, and presently in he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hinkley,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;I'm going to promote you. To-morrow you may go
      to the plant at Amadam. You shall have a 3-per-cent, interest in the
      profits of that enterprise. Go ahead and make them as big as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hinkley returned to his bench in a grateful spirit, although a bit
      puzzled, as I saw by the look of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we were alone, McCarthy turned with a smile and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, the plant at Amadam is a reformatory for the promoted. Of
      course, it doesn't make any money, and as soon as it begins to lose a
      hundred dollars a month I shall stop it, and they'll be out in the cold
      world. I'm fair with them; they have a chance to make some profit if they
      will and keep their jobs. It's their funeral, not mine. If any man
      improves there, and develops talent and good-will, I promote him back to
      the home shop. If any one is unmanageable, I promote him to the
      soap-grease department at Buffalo. There I have a hard boss, and the
      probationer will do one of two things&mdash;reform or resign. He either
      improves or discharges himself. I never discharge any one.&rdquo; After a
      moment's pause, he went on: &ldquo;Now we'll send for Mr. Horace Bulger and give
      him some work to do. He should be able to stop the strike now. We've done
      him a great favor.&rdquo; The Honorable Bulger came soon, and promptly the
      hand-made gentleman gave him a word of advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better stop this trouble in my factory, if you can,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble you started some time ago; it's your trouble now. The men
      have decided to strike to-morrow. You'll have to make peace, or I'm
      defeated and you lose your money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bulger rose with a worried look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say a word to them,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;let me do the talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further reply, Mr. Bulger hurried into the factory. For the first
      time in his life this wily, easy-going gentleman had work to do, and it
      gave him no rest. Gaffney helped him, and he kept-the men with us,
      although they had gone so far in the way of discontent, upon which he
      himself had led them, that Mr. Bulger was in sore trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old and new forces had begun a conflict which was to last for half a
      century. Hand labor <i>versus</i> machines became an issue in the campaign
      of James Henry McCarthy, and nearly defeated him. He went to New York and
      remained there until Bulger had struggled up to the convention with a
      majority of two. When the nomination was secure he told us about one of
      the winning votes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a stubborn fight in the town of Edgewood. The night before the
      caucus he knew that he needed one vote to secure his delegate. A
      politician of the name of Barber had worked against him, and spent a good
      deal of money. Late in the evening he hired a horse and drove to the house
      of a certain farmer who lived about a mile from the village. He had
      learned that Barber had bought the vote of this man. The farmer let him
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk with you and your wife about an important matter,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they both sat beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are supposed to be respectable people,&rdquo; said Bulger. &ldquo;You have some
      property and two children, and of course you'd like to have a good name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, I've come here to inform you that Barber got drunk this
      evening, and has been telling down there at the hotel that he had bought
      your vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't you vote for his candidate,&rdquo; said the wife to her husband. &ldquo;If
      you do, everybody will believe the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he voted for our delegate,&rdquo; said Bulger, as he turned to the
      hand-made gentleman. &ldquo;That's the kind of a fight I've had on my hands, but
      now the worst is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said McCarthy. &ldquo;There's the shame of such a victory, and that
      will fall upon me. I don't like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you're one o' them high-moral cusses!&rdquo; said Mr. Bulger, with a look
      of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said the hand-made gentleman: &ldquo;My morals are just high enough to
      believe in fair play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you don't have to answer for my sins,&rdquo; Mr. Bulger retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're in the game of politics, young man,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bulger went on. &ldquo;You've got to take it as it is or keep out. It's as
      tricky and full o' bluff as a game o' poker. I'd like to see you make it
      better. You'll have a chance by-and-by; go ahead and see what you can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, there was some mud-flinging in the campaign, and Mr. McCarthy was
      blamed for the sins of Bulger, and came to his honors by-and-by with
      tempered enthusiasm and increased humility. A certain newspaper had
      opposed him with cruel vindictiveness. It told of his humble origin, and
      called him &ldquo;Pegleg McCarthy&rdquo; and &ldquo;the son of a washwoman&rdquo; and &ldquo;a man of
      vaulting and unwarranted ambitions.&rdquo; These were the poisoned arrows of a
      rude time, and they scarred the soul of McCarthy and helped to make him a
      fighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile I sat one evening in the shop with Pearl and Barker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mack is a great boy,&rdquo; said my old friend. &ldquo;Sat here until midnight the
      other evening; said he hated politics, and wished he was out of it. I
      called Barker up, and give him a talkin' to right then and there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the talented young lady?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe he'll marry her. He ain't so green as he used to be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a rap at the basement door. I opened it, and four
      masked men crowded over its threshold. I grappled with their leader, for
      the truth had flashed upon me&mdash;they were after Pearl, &ldquo;the machine
      man.&rdquo; I fought like a tiger, and stopped them for a second there by the
      doorway, and then they stopped me. One of them threw a piece of iron and
      struck me in the face with it; but I had saved my friend, with the help of
      Mr. Barker, who had seized one by the seat of his trousers. I came to in a
      dash of spray. A man had fallen across my legs and another lay near me. I
      saw a shaft of water strike a third and lift him off his feet and hurl him
      through the open doorway. He went like a leaf in the wind. A dash of spray
      put out the lamp. I scrambled to my feet, and stood to my ankles in water.
      I could hear the turbine purring like a great cat. In a second Pearl's
      electric lamp, that hung from the ceiling, began to glow. He stood by the
      pen-stock with a big iron nozzle in his hand. Two men lay near me. The
      water had struck like a sand-bag, and knocked the breath out of them. They
      had come to, and begun making for the open door on their hands and knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, boys,&rdquo; said the Pearl, pleasantly; &ldquo;call again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door and bolted it, and took his pistol from a closet and
      turned off the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;we've got to make for a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At precisely that moment I began to feel the pain in my nose and the
      warmth of my own blood on its way to the floor. We hurried up a stairway,
      and through the long hall, and out of the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, old boy,&rdquo; Pearl said, warmly, as he took my arm in his, &ldquo;you have
      won further promotion for meritorious conduct. I make you my hero as well
      as my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did little,&rdquo; was my answer; &ldquo;but I should like to know what it was that
      you did to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the ol' mare o' the river,&rdquo; said Pearl. &ldquo;I had her fixed so I
      could cut her loose. She just h'isted up her hind legs an' threw 'em into
      every corner o' the shop. An' they hit hard. Ye see, I was expectin' 'em.
      Had a spout rigged at the bottom o' the pen-stock with a double j'int in
      the neck of it. The ol' mare jumped through it an' raised&rdquo;&mdash;he
      checked himself, and added&mdash;&ldquo;everything in reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My nose had been badly cut and broken, and I was a month in the Albany
      hospital undergoing repairs, and came out with this battered visage. I
      wept when I saw myself in the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not so very bad, you see, after all, but that day I thought it bad
      enough to make a dog bark at me. I gave up all thought of marriage, but&mdash;yes,
      oh yes, dear child, I loved her more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember the day that Pearl came down to cheer me up. He put his hand on
      my head and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry about that, boy. It's your medal of honor, and you can't hide
      it under your vest, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We learned that the men had worse injuries, and before a day had passed
      their names were known, and within a week they were promoted to the grease
      department. They had planned to tar and feather my friend and carry him
      out of the village on a fence-rail, and Pearl and his &ldquo;old mare&rdquo; had
      exposed and kicked them out of favor in their own ranks. The working-men
      turned to McCarthy, and always stood by him after that.

      REMAINED at Rushwater to run the shop while McCarthy was beginning his
      legislative career. I was going about a good deal looking after branches
      in Chicago and New York. The hand-made gentleman was at home and doing
      something for Sal in the intervals of adjournment, but I saw little of
      him. Two or three times in my absence he called to see my mother and
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had returned from a long journey, one evening Sarah said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen that girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. McCarthy's girl&mdash;the one you say he loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I don't like her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe she cares for him, and she ought to be ashamed of
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My sister turned away, her cheeks red with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No woman has any right to marry a man that she does not love,&rdquo; she went
      on. &ldquo;Do you really think he cares for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do hope she makes him a good wife. They are to be married in
      June.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In June!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he spoke of it one evening to mother and me, and looked as if he
      were talking about his funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be something has come between them,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but he will keep his
      word if he dies for it, unless&mdash;well, no sentimental reason would
      turn him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a wonderful man he is!&rdquo; said Sarah; and then she brought my slippers
      to me, and came and sat on the arm of my chair and tenderly stroked my
      weary head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a wonderful sister you are, and how beautiful you have grown!
      Some day you will be getting married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, as she put her arms around my neck; &ldquo;I am going to
      live with you and mother, if you will let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many fine young fellows who come to see her,&rdquo; said my mother,
      who had been sitting near us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not care for them,&rdquo; Sarah answered, as she rose and left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the hand-made gentleman was changing. The legislature adjourned
      in April, and then we saw much of him, and the wear of problems deeper
      than those I shared had begun to show in his face. Moreover, his plans had
      changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall need you with me at Albany and everywhere,&rdquo; he said, one evening
      when we were alone together in the office. &ldquo;There are plenty of business
      men, but there is only one Jacob Heron. I've got another man for the shop,
      and you and I will start for Pittsburg in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Pittsburg!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they've asked me to 'look into the subject of rails and signals,'&rdquo;
       he went on. &ldquo;The superintendent of the Western Division of the
      Pennsylvania Railroad is a man of the name of Andrew Carnegie. He has
      invented a block-signal system to enable trains to keep their speed with
      safety. He knows more about iron than any other man in the world, and is
      the head of the Keystone Bridge Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, we've got to have a new kind of iron. Our rails are breaking
      down. They can't stand up under heavy loads and big engines. The country
      will have to poke along at twenty miles an hour until we can get something
      better. On our way we'll stop in New York and see the Commodore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began to think of my mother and sister, who had come to live with me in
      Rushwater. He seemed to read my thoughts, for he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can take the folks to Albany if you like. They've never seen much of
      city life; I'm sure they'd like it; and, say, do you&mdash;do you suppose
      they'd be willing to put up with me for a boarder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure they'd be glad to have you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't tell 'em that I spoke of it, but just propose the thing and see
      what they say. You can be frank with me. We ought to know each other well
      enough for that. I'm afraid you're just a little too much inclined to
      please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not without provocation,&rdquo; I remarked, having great respect for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want you to find fault with me,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;I'm far from perfect.
      Just remember that I'm trying to improve myself. All that I know I picked
      up here and there. If you hear me say anything that doesn't sound right, I
      want you to tell me. I want you to look over me a little every day, and
      tell me if I dress and act as a gentleman ought to. You've seen how people
      do in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've often thought that I would speak to you about the color of your
      neckties,&rdquo; I suggested, mildly. &ldquo;You seem to like red as well as I do, but
      it is not the best form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, blushing, and took from his pocket a twenty-dollar bill, and
      said: &ldquo;I'm glad you spoke of it. Take this and go and get me some good
      ties in the morning. If you see anything that you think I need, buy it; my
      credit is good here. But there's another matter&mdash;my soul is feeling a
      bit shabby and ashamed of itself; it needs a little advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the trouble?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've found a greater power than the push of steam or water or
      electricity. It can put them all out of business&mdash;it could stop every
      wheel in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and I looked into his eyes and guessed his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is love, and it has stopped me,&rdquo; he went on&mdash;&ldquo;stopped me on the
      brink of a precipice. I don't know what to do. I wish I were somebody&mdash;anybody
      but the low-bred, common, Pegleg McCarthy that I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice began to tremble a bit, and he left his chair and walked up and
      down the room in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't throw mud on yourself,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;There are plenty of us who
      would like to be that same McCarthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not so bad,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;The trouble is, I have the pride of a king
      in me and the blood of a hodman. But I may do something by-and-by. I've
      been reading about Lincoln. He was a man of humble birth and limited
      education. It gave me hope for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the trouble?&rdquo; I asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have met the woman I love, and she is not Miss Manning,&rdquo; he continued.
      &ldquo;She is a lady&mdash;the sweetest, dearest lady in the land, and so far
      above me that we could never be man and wife. But I love her. God! she is
      more to me than all the rest of the world. I have nothing in me but the
      thought of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away and fussed with the papers on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care no more for business,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and the honors I had hoped
      for are nothing to me now. All my plans are like the withered stems of a
      garden sticking out of the snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strode up and down the room and stopped before me, and something out of
      the depths of his heart shone in his countenance and lifted him to
      greatness, it seemed to me, so that he saw his way clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do my work,&rdquo; he said, solemnly. &ldquo;I will do what my God tells me
      to do. I will try to be good enough for her&mdash;that is something&mdash;and
      I shall marry Miss Manning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you ought to do that?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I have promised, and a
      gentleman keeps his word unless&mdash;unless there's some good reason why
      he shouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sometimes thought that she was not the woman for you,&rdquo; I
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I. Poor girl! We're quick to judge, and not any of us are
      perfect. My life isn't much; I'm glad to give it for a principle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know how you feel,&rdquo; I said, thinking of my own troubles. &ldquo;But then it
      may be that she doesn't care for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've got to believe her, haven't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;if&mdash;if she's a lady,&rdquo; was my answer. &ldquo;Well, you see, I'm a
      pretty common fellow myself, and I must treat other people as I would have
      them treat me. Miss Manning is a good-hearted girl; she's had bad luck&mdash;the
      company stranded, and all that. In the morning I wish you to go to New
      York and find her. She lives at the Waverly Place Hotel. I'll give you a
      check signed in blank. Get a schedule of her debts, if possible; satisfy
      yourself as to the sum she really needs if it takes a week, and make the
      check for any amount you think best. When you're ready, wire me, and I'll
      meet you and we'll go on to Pittsburg. One moment,&rdquo; he added, as I was
      leaving him, &ldquo;you will be apt to find her at home about six. If she isn't
      there, her maid will tell you where she is, and you might look her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious mission&mdash;the kind of duty one would rarely delegate
      to another. Yet, somehow, it was characteristic of the gentleman to be
      frank and businesslike, even in a matter of benevolence. But how was I to
      learn what sum &ldquo;she really needed&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a train in the morning, and about six that afternoon called at the
      rooms of Miss Manning, in Waverly Place. She had gone to dine at
      Delmonico's, the maid told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delmonico's! I had heard of the famous cafÃ© and restaurant, the resort of
      the rich and the high-born, where, it was soberly affirmed, one could pay,
      and many had paid, as much as ten dollars for a dinner. I had plenty of
      money, and a feeling of opulence, too, and decided that I would go and
      have a look at the place and the people and the food, for I had no notion
      that I should like the taste of it. So I put on my best clothes, and
      walked down Broadway, and entered as boldly as if I had been there every
      day of my life. A young man of the name of Gillette, whom I remembered
      meeting one day at a tea-party at Mrs. Schermerhom's, rose from one of the
      tables and greeted me. My memory was better than his, for I recollect that
      he addressed me as &ldquo;Mr. Horn,&rdquo; and talked so volubly that he gave me no
      opportunity of correcting him. He had heard of my injuries, and assured me
      of his sorrow, and asked me to join his dinnerparty at a large, round
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really need you, old man,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You see, one of my friends
      has disappointed me, and there's an empty chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I accepted his kindness, and he presented me as &ldquo;Mr. Horn,&rdquo; and as &ldquo;my old
      friend, Mr. Horn,&rdquo; so what could I do but accept the name and make the
      best of it. Well, to my great surprise, one of the ladies at the table was
      Miss Manning herself, and a very handsome girl she was. I was about to say
      that I knew a friend of hers when it occurred to me that if I did I should
      have to explain that my name was Heron and not Horn, and so embarrass the
      friendly Mr. Gillette. I said nothing, therefore, and was soon glad of my
      forbearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were drinking freely save myself, and by-and-by the conversation grew
      oddly intimate and the manners most unrestrained. Miss Manning held the
      hand of the young man who sat beside her, and spoke freely of her &ldquo;angel&rdquo;
       up the State, who was going to marry her; and I could not hold up my head
      or heart in the midst of it, and excused myself and left them with a kind
      of world-sickness in me&mdash;the first touch of it that I had known. Yet,
      as the friend of a noble gentleman, I thanked God for it all, and the
      great soul of McCarthy himself could not have felt a keener pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I telegraphed to my friend that I had finished my work, and next evening
      he met me at the St. Nicholas. He came into my room and pressed my hand
      eagerly, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's new?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;it's a rather old story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw Miss Manning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And gave her the check?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I return the check to you,&rdquo; I said, and briefly gave my reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heron, most any one can obey orders, but the man who knows enough to
      disobey them to save a principal is above price,&rdquo; he said, as he shook my
      hand again. &ldquo;I couldn't say a word of my suspicions, for, you know, one
      has to be careful not to injure a lady. For fear of that I couldn't bring
      myself to engage a detective to watch her&mdash;it seemed so brutal and
      ruthless and cold-blooded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away, and for a moment neither spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure that you would know how to do the errand,&rdquo; he added. .
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCarthy drew a letter from his pocket and flung it on the table, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will understand me when you have read that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew the letter from the envelope, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCarthy,&mdash;You are being deceived, and I write to warn you about
      Miss Manning. If you or any friend of yours would go to her hotel
      unexpected, almost any evening about dinner-time, you could learn where to
      find her. I could tell you many things, but you might as well learn them
      for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Well-Wisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was written by her maid,&rdquo; said McCarthy, as I returned the
      letter. &ldquo;But come, come, we are due at the Commodore's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We hurried away, and as we left the inn I could not help thinking how
      cleverly he had planned my errand of good-will.

    <p>
      E took an omnibus, and were presently in the big house on Washington
      Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, young man!&rdquo; said the Commodore, as he took the hand of McCarthy.
      &ldquo;Going out to the stable to look at a sick horse. Come along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He donned his overcoat, which had a collar of gray fur of about the shade
      of his hair, and it put a wonderful finish on him. I never saw in all my
      life a better figure of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went with him to a large stable back of the house. I recall my wonder
      at its size and comfort and cleanliness, and the splendor of its many
      vehicles and trappings. Yet it was not fine enough for the Commodore, who,
      seeing a wisp of straw on the floor of the carriage-room, larrupped the
      coachman with high words. Then a quick, spoken command:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring out the mare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out came the mare in a jiffy, and Mr. Vanderbilt looked into her mouth and
      felt her throat and legs, and said, presently, &ldquo;Take her back, and have
      her bled in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He let down the shafts of a light road-wagon and rolled it to the middle
      of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a good wagon,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Take hold of the axle and heft it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We did so, and were surprised at the lightness of the graceful thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much heavier than a tom-cat,&rdquo; said the Commodore, &ldquo;and it cost me ten
      thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten thousand dollars! Why, it cost as much as a house!&rdquo; said Mr.
      McCarthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as some houses,&rdquo; the Commodore went on. &ldquo;I sent for a good
      carriage-builder and told him to plan the lightest wagon that would safely
      carry my weight. He brought the plan for a fifty-eight pound wagon at
      fifteen hundred dollars. 'Twon't do,' says I. 'Make it just as strong and
      five pounds lighter and I'll double your pay.' Well, he came back
      by-and-by with a plan for a fifty-pound wagon for three thousand dollars.
      'That's the best you can do, is it?' says I. 'Well,' says he, 'I might get
      it down a few ounces if I had time to study the problem.' 'Take time,'
      says I, 'and I'll pay you a hundred dollars an ounce for all the weight
      you can take out of the wagon, but you must keep it as strong as it is
      now.' He took four pounds off the weight of it, and the saving cost me
      sixteen hundred dollars a pound. Money is quite a stimulant if it's used
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman stood looking thoughtfully at the Commodore. When the story
      was finished he struck the air with his hand, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vanderbilt, that wagon is worth its weight in diamonds.&rdquo; We looked
      into his glowing eyes, and he went on: &ldquo;Let me tell you why. If brains,
      rightly stimulated, can reduce the weight of a road-wagon without any loss
      of strength, let's see what they can do with our big, clumsy freight and
      passenger cars. If we could take a hundred pounds off every car in the
      country, think what it would mean. That weight could be turned from
      expense into income. Think of the saving in power and fuel. It would mean
      millions of dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boy, go to work on that proposition,&rdquo; said the Commodore. &ldquo;I'll
      give you a dollar for every pound you save on every car that runs over my
      tracks. I wish to God that my boy Bill had your push!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind, sir,&rdquo; said McCarthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for the weight of your head,&rdquo; Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vanderbilt continued; &ldquo;it's your freight-car&mdash;remember that&mdash;and
      you don't want to carry any sap in it. Let me tell you a story: Bill is a
      fat, good-natured cuss, and wants to take it easy, like all boys with a
      rich father. I told him that I wouldn't have him loafing around, and I
      sent him down on the farm and put him to work there, and Bill is getting
      along. He played a good joke on me, and I've made up my mind that he'll do
      for the railroad business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says to me the other day, 'Father, I need some manure for the farm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, boy, how much do you want?' I says. &ldquo;'Seven or eight loads,' says
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How much 'll you pay a load?' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A dollar a load,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'All right,' I says to him, 'come over to the car-stables and get all you
      need at that figure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose the cuss done to me? He come over and got eight
      schooner loads!&rdquo; Mr. Vanderbilt roared with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You're no farmer,' I says to him. 'Come right over and learn the
      railroad business.'&rdquo; The Commodore pushed the road-wagon back into its
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your way to Pittsburg?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Mr. McCarthy
      answered, with a sly wink at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything more to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good. It's a wise man that knows when he's said enough.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. McCarthy and I left to go to our inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'On your way to Pittsburg?'&rdquo; said the handmade gentleman, repeating the
      query of the Commodore. &ldquo;How did he know that I was going to Pittsburg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's been at work on your programme, perhaps,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has a hand in the affairs of the Central system,&rdquo; my friend went on.
      &ldquo;That's his way of telling me. He has bought the Harlem and Hudson River
      roads, and has the ring in the bull's nose, and the continuous route is
      now a certainty. But we are not to talk too much. You can make up your
      mind that the Commodore knows all about us. I probably don't say or do
      much that isn't reported to him. A foolish word or two and he would be
      done with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My friend went to see Miss Manning, but soon joined me at the inn and
      reported that she was not at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight we were on our way to Philadelphia in a draughty coach. It was
      an up-to-date train, equipped with the Miller platform, coupler, and
      buffer, which gave it a continuous floor and cane-woven seats, and the
      trainmen carried the new movable globe lantern. The rails were joined so
      as to soften the tread of the wheels, but still the bang, bang of them at
      the rails' ends filled the train with its clamor. We had brought a couple
      of shawls with us, and we used them for pillows, and lay half reclining on
      the hard seats beneath our overcoats. We slept a little in spite of the
      roaring wheels and rattling windows and the shriek of the trainmen at all
      the stops and the snore-streaked, chilly silences that followed, and rose
      stiff and sore at daybreak to wait for the west-bound train. It was hard
      travel, but far easier than that of the stage-coach, of which my mother
      had told me, and in those days it seemed like the height of luxury. All
      next day and another night we travelled, and Mr. Carnegie met us at the
      Pittsburg depot at eight o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of about thirty years, with a full brown beard and keen, gray
      eyes and an alert and courteous manner. He showed us through the Union
      Iron Mills, where they had begun to make and handle castings heavy as a
      house by steam-power, and as easily as a lady swings her fan. There
      weapons for the war with distance were being made. Bones of the mountains
      were melting in great heat and running into rails and beams to bridge the
      pathless fields and the river chasms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk with you about the rail problem,&rdquo; said McCarthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nearly solved,&rdquo; said Mr. Carnegie. &ldquo;The rail of the future will be
      made of Bessemer steel. It can stand heat and cold and heavy pressure.
      We'll be making them here as soon as possible. I think within a year or
      two this company will be able to fill your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a warm day in April, and Mr. McCarthy and I had removed our coats.
      The city was celebrating the surrender at Appomattox, and, driving toward
      the depot, we came into full streets and met a procession led by cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we had better get out and take the sidewalk,&rdquo; said Mr. Carnegie.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left the carriage, and suddenly the gentleman said, &ldquo;I must go back
      after my coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; the other asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't be polite for me to walk in the streets without a coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, take mine,&rdquo; said Mr. Carnegie, as he removed his own, which
      McCarthy declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an odd exhibit from the old and new schools of gentlemanhood, of
      the formality of Chesterfield&mdash;of which Mr. McCarthy had long been a
      student&mdash;and the simplicity of Abraham Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, the war is over,&rdquo; said Mr. Carnegie, as he went on, &ldquo;but the
      military spirit is everywhere, and it will die slowly. I feel it more and
      more in business. Do you know that business is beginning to be a kind of
      warfare in which victory is the chief end, and all is well that leads to
      it? War is a crime. It sanctions murder and teaches dishonesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have felt the spirit you complain of,&rdquo; said the hand-made gentleman.
      &ldquo;In my business there are scouts and spies, and I have had trouble in
      which violence and threats of murder were resorted to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the teaching of war, and battles of business are coming in which
      blood will flow, and the gun and torch will play their part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The distinguished railroader shook his head, and his face kindled with old
      Celtic fire as he thought of war's iniquity. He was unlike, and yet very
      like, my friend McCarthy. They had both gone through the same hard school
      of poverty, and with like endowments had reached the same high footing. A
      friendship began between them of much value to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we sat in the office of the young Scot he explained his signal system,
      and spoke of other needs, especially of better rails and road-beds and
      comfortable sleeping-cars, and the continuous trip to Chicago. Both
      clearly foresaw, in part, the great things which have come to us. I
      remember that McCarthy made me think him rash when he spoke of moving
      hotels that would some day convey one across the continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      They dived into the past also, and began to talk of their boyhood. We had
      gone out to look at the new Woodruff sleeping-car, and dined and returned
      to Mr. Carnegie's office, where we spent the evening together. I sat by
      and listened to the talk of the others, and I remember well how it
      thrilled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carnegie had spoken of the war spirit, which had begun to show itself in
      business. The brave ventures of these two had in them a touch of the
      hazard-loving, heroic courage of the soldier. I thought of this, and yet I
      had no suspicion that they were to be great generals in the new war. God
      had armed them for the mighty struggles of peace. They had learned that
      when two forces were joined something comes of it vastly greater than
      their sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would help me to account for you,&rdquo; said McCarthy. &ldquo;Tell me how
      you got it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean this stupidity and this luck of mine,&rdquo; said Carnegie, with a
      smile. &ldquo;It's a good deal to account for, but I'll try.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went into business when I was six years old&mdash;raised pigeons and
      rabbits. Other boys helped me, and were rewarded by having rabbits named
      after them. My hero was Wallace Bruce. Often I had to pass a graveyard at
      night, and was a bit afraid of it. Then I used to say to myself that
      Wallace would not be so foolish, and went on with a better heart in me. In
      many a time of trouble I have asked myself what Wallace would do, and have
      tried to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came to America when I was eleven, and I began work across the river,
      in Allegheny City, at one dollar and twenty cents a week. You know this is
      a time of business combinations. I made one of the first on record. It was
      this way: I got to be a messenger boy at two dollars and a half a week,
      and learned the names of all the business firms, in their proper order, on
      the leading streets. There were four of us who delivered for the telegraph
      company, and each got ten cents when a message took him beyond city
      limits. There was a contest between the boys for these messages. I got
      them together, and suggested that the extra fees be divided equally. We
      made a sort of pool, or trust, and never quarrelled again. You see, I am
      at heart a peacemaker. I have always worked along that line&mdash;putting
      two and two together, and establishing harmony between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what Lincoln has done,&rdquo; said McCarthy. &ldquo;At last he has brought
      the North and South together, and begun to establish harmony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the first gentleman in the world,&rdquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he is a very great one,&rdquo; said McCarthy, &ldquo;but I wish he were a
      little more particular in his dress and manners. I don't believe he's read
      the <i>Letters of Lord Chesterfield</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the modern democratic gentleman,&rdquo; said Mr. Carnegie. &ldquo;He has shown
      us how little dress and manners have to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carnegie stopped, for suddenly a man had rushed in upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he sobbed, as he sank into a chair with tears running down his
      cheeks, &ldquo;Lincoln has been assassinated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside bells had begun tolling, and we could hear the running of many
      feet.

    <p>
      E had little heart for the rest of our business. The whole city was like
      the house of mourning. Shops and mills, were closed, and the street
      crowded with those who could neither sleep nor rest nor cease talking.
      Some wept, some prayed, some told of fearful dreams and strange
      imaginings. I heard men declare that they had seen blood dripping from the
      flags just before Lincoln was shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to one of the mines, and then to Harrisburg, and waited for the
      funeral train. The car which Mr. Lincoln had used on the United States
      military road was to convey his body to the home he had left long before
      to continue the work now finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The car of the president of the Baltimore road, with its parlor, bedroom,
      dining-room, and kitchen, was to convey the family and their immediate
      friends to the same destination. These cars were to be transferred from
      one road to another, and rolled into Springfield, Illinois. As a railroad
      enterprise, it marked the beginning of new things. The train came in a
      rain at 8.30 on the evening of April 21st, its cars and engine
      heavily-draped. We had telegraphed for permission to ride on the
      pilot-engine, which was to lead the way north half an hour ahead of the
      train. About midnight word came to us that our request would be granted.
      Next morning at 10 the bearers arrived at the depot with the body, which
      had been lying in state at the City Hall of Harrisburg, and the bearers
      conveyed it to the funeral car. Big panels of plate-glass in the sides of
      this car enabled one to see the coffin from the street level. The engine
      had her bell muffled, and large portraits of Lincoln, draped with black
      crape edged with silver lace, on either side of her cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 10.30 we left on the pilot engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, my children, we began to know, then, what had happened. Oh, it was a
      wonderful thing to see and feel&mdash;the love of millions! The railroad&mdash;why,
      it was a way of sorrow sprinkled with tears. North to Albany and west to
      Springfield the people stood deep on either side of the long ironway. I
      saw them waiting patiently in sleet and rain, some weeping, some kneeling
      as we passed, thinking, no doubt, that he they loved was among us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We left the pilot-engine in Philadelphia and hurried to a city on the Erie
      road, where we had work to do. We reached Albany some days later, about an
      hour ahead of the funeral train. There the beloved President was to be
      taken from the train and borne to the State-House, so that those of the
      north country might have a look at him. We waited among tens of thousands
      gathered in the streets, and the train came at midnight. I shall never
      forget the hush that fell upon all as the body passed in the darkness, and
      the low, tremulous murmur of the crowd. It was like the sound of a great
      bass string when it is lightly touched&mdash;it was the note of a people's
      sorrow. Slowly, silently, we made our way to the State-House. All about us
      men and women were sobbing, and we said not a word to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment my tears blinded me at the bier, for there by the coffin-head
      stood Pearl, in the uniform of a sergeant, with three medals on his blue
      cape. A squad of veterans walled the passage. Pearl stood calm and erect,
      with strange authority in his scarred face. He was the soldier again. A
      little ahead of me, as I walked in line, were Jo and Colonel Busby. I saw
      the Colonel seize the hand of Pearl and speak to him, but only a word. I
      did my best to gain the side of Jo, and failed&mdash;there were so many
      between us. Soon I had lost sight of them in the crowd and the darkness
      beyond the open doors. It would all have been different maybe&mdash;all in
      these latter years of our history&mdash;but for those twenty feet or so
      that lay between us that night. Just that little glimpse of her face,
      ennobled by our common sorrow, revived my love of her, and then I knew
      that even if I lost her I should never lose that. I hoped that we should
      find them next day, and so contented myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      McCarthy and I walked to our inn together, and talked of the wonderful
      things we had seen and of the great captain of the people. We had read
      many columns in the press which had told of the gentleness of his heart
      and of his simplicity, which had amounted to uncouthness in the view of
      some.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The outside of a man isn't of so much importance, after all,&rdquo; said my
      friend, as we were going to bed. &ldquo;The gentleman is a lover of men, and
      seeks not to charm but only to serve them. And when he passes away it is
      as if there were some one dead in every house that knew him. Let us pray
      God to help us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We knelt by our beds in silence, and so ended one of the saddest days in
      my history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I tried to find the Colonel and Jo, but with no success. I
      found Pearl, soon after dinner, sitting on the steps of an old church. His
      head rested on his hands; his cheeks were tear-stained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know Mr. Lincoln?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about him,&rdquo; I said, as I sat down by my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you'll hear of that some time,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I'm goin' to stop
      talkin' and mournin', and go back to Rushwater and get to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's find McCarthy,&rdquo; I said, and we rose and walked toward the Delevan
      House. &ldquo;Last night I saw you shake hands with Colonel Busby,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I knew the Colonel long ago, and we met here yesterday,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where they are now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They left this morning to make a trip around the world. She is to be
      married on their return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married! To whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it happened that I gave up the last dream of my youth.

      HE end of the war was come, and McCarthy and I felt a sense of shame and
      sorrow that we had had no part in it&mdash;he, because of his wooden leg;
      and I, because of those who were dependent upon me. But soon we were to
      find ourselves in the first great battle of peace, one of those of which
      the iron-master had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The States had put aside their jealousy, and begun to pull together in
      enterprises the like of which had never been known. We were laying iron
      rails across the deserts, and would soon be scaling the Rockies with them.
      Engines had climbed the Alps and swung in little curves, hauling a
      forty-ton train over Mont Cenis and the Semmering at twelve miles an hour.
      But the work we had begun was vaster and more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in January, 1866, when we were together in Albany, that the
      gentleman said to me one day:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The battle is on. I knew it was coming, although I haven't said anything
      about it. The Central is fighting the Commodore. He has so much power in
      the board that they're afraid of him. In summer they've been sending their
      south-bound freight by the river boats. In winter, when the river was
      closed, of course they've been glad to use the Vanderbilt roads to New
      York. The Commodore has got ugly, and begun to jerk the bull ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bull ring!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It's the middle of January, and the ice is a foot
      thick on the Hudson, and, somehow, the Central freight doesn't move.
      They've begun to yell at the Commodore, and he answers, 'Use the boats.'
      'They answer, 'The river is frozen.' He says, 'Well, pull your trains into
      Albany on time, and I'll do my best for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, there's where he's got 'em. They can't get here on time, and never
      do. Their freight is piling up, their passengers never make their
      connections for the South. The Commodore's trains used to wait, now they
      leave promptly on time. Lately there's been something the matter with the
      tracks on the east side of the river, and Mr. Vanderbilt's trains haven't
      been able to reach Albany at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman paused, and began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Central yards and storehouses are overflowing, patrons and
      stockholders have set up a howl,&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Progress,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;God has found the will of a CÃ¦sar to perform His
      wonders. When it's time for a great thing to be done, it's done, and
      little people have to get out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the bull ring seems to me rather oppressive,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is oppressive, and a godsend, too, when the bull won't lead,&rdquo; said the
      gentleman. &ldquo;What would you do with men like Richmond and Drew? Would you
      try to persuade them? Suppose, too, there were a lot of people who
      expected you to bribe them out of the way? Why, in such a case we need
      power, and it's down at No. 10 Washington Square. In a month Mr.
      Vanderbilt will own the Central lines, then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman paused, and turned and looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's the beginning of a new emancipation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will break
      the bonds of distance and set us free. In a few years we shall take our
      train in New York and leave it in San Francisco. The desert plains will be
      settled and tilled, and there will be great cities where there's nothing
      now but gophers and wild sage. Why, in the Far West there's land enough
      for all the oppressed of Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time that I had heard the phrase now so well worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a week new schedules were established, and Central freight and
      passengers went on without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all settled,&rdquo; said McCarthy. &ldquo;My dream is coming true. Soon there'll
      be one system from New York and Boston to Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But things not so cheerful were pressing on us. My mother and sister and I
      had taken a small furnished house in Albany, and fitted up a room for the
      gentleman, agreeably with his own plan, for he had been urgent in his wish
      to live with us. Months had passed, but the room was still unoccupied. My
      sister had made it cosey and homelike, with the pretty arts of a
      school-girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think it's lovely?&rdquo; she said to me one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's a charming room!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder why he doesn't like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that he does like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he's only been here once since it was ready,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Just one
      look at that room was enough for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away, and when I went and put my arm around her waist and
      kissed her I saw that there were tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You silly child,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are fond of him!&rdquo; I had not dreamed of
      such a thing, and yet I ought to have known it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah began to laugh, and ran away from me and up-stairs to her room. The
      revelation worried me, and that very day I had a talk with my mother about
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarah will get over that,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;All boys and girls have their
      little troubles. You had yours, and have recovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; was my answer. &ldquo;If it takes hold of her as it took hold of me,
      God pity her. I shall not fall in love again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to hear you say that,&rdquo; said my mother. &ldquo;Jo treats you very
      badly. Sarah had a letter from her the other day, and there was not a word
      for you in it. They are in India, and intend to stay there for a year or
      so. It seems rather strange to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's some reason&mdash;I'm sure she means well,&rdquo; I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening McCarthy and I sat together in his room at the Delevan
      writing letters until midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of the ring in the bull's nose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what do you think of
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed me a letter from a firm of New York lawyers in behalf of Maud
      Isabel Manning. They demanded that he keep his promise to marry the young
      woman or pay a &ldquo;reasonable sum&rdquo; in damages. That sum should be, in their
      opinion, forty thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in an awful mess,&rdquo; he said, as he turned to me with a troubled look
      in his face. &ldquo;There's a quotation from Ecclesiastes that fits the case
      pretty well:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets,
      and her hands as bands.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jake, you know now why I couldn't go and live in your house, with this
      thing hanging over me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not quite understand you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as times are, if I had to pay that sum of money it would ruin me,&rdquo;
       he declared. &ldquo;I don't see how I can go to law with them and smirch myself
      and you with scandal, to say nothing of the girl&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't worry about her,&rdquo; I interrupted, with a smile. &ldquo;As to myself,
      I'll tell all I know as publicly as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel disgraced enough already,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but worse things are coming.
      I'm not going to lie down and let them rob me. I shall fight them, but not
      with your testimony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your friend&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he interrupted, as he closed his desk. &ldquo;Heron, I'm in love with
      your sister. I have never told her or any one. It may be a hopeless love;
      but, you see, it won't answer for you to have anything to do with this
      case, and I must keep away from your house until I am done with it. Your
      sister is sacred to me. I must keep her name as far from mine as possible
      until I am vindicated and free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then James Henry McCarthy&mdash;a gentleman than whom no knight of old had
      better chivalry&mdash;shook my hand and bade me good-night.

    <p>
      HOSE days there were few if any bribe agreements made in Albany. Sometimes
      a member would find money in his mail from unnamed but not, probably, from
      unknown sources, or now and then a good team or a pair of oxen would be
      delivered at his farm as &ldquo;a token of regard&rdquo; or &ldquo;the tribute of
      admiration.&rdquo; But &ldquo;the lobby,&rdquo; while on its way, had not yet arrived at the
      capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been noised abroad that Vanderbilt had control of all the great
      railroads in the State except the Erie, and was likely soon to acquire
      that&mdash;Vanderbilt, then worth forty million dollars! Clever and
      unscrupulous men, who foresaw that he would have favors to ask of the
      Legislature, began to hustle for seats. Next session a number of these
      came on with credentials, some who had failed of election came also, and
      began to organize &ldquo;the third house,&rdquo; as the lobby was called later.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spent the last day or two of every week at Rushwater looking after the
      shop, which had an excellent manager, and things had gone well with us.
      The gentleman had been returned to the legislature without a word of
      opposition, and was known far and wide as the &ldquo;cowcatcher.&rdquo; He stood for
      progress, and was, indeed, a little in advance of it, and pushed things
      out of the way. He was polite&mdash;always polite&mdash;but as firm as
      iron. No word of vituperation ever escaped his lips, and yet he had a most
      dreaded and terrible gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, just before the beginning of the session, an important man came
      to us with plans for a bridge of vast proportions to span the Hudson at
      Poughkeepsie. It was a daring, a magnificent, design of the best
      engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you aiming at?&rdquo; McCarthy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important man explained the purpose of the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; said McCarthy. &ldquo;Now, please, say what you want of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want you to get the charter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you planning to spend any money here for that purpose?&rdquo; McCarthy
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll lay out any reasonable sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I won't have a thing to do with it&mdash;not a thing,&rdquo; said the
      gentleman. &ldquo;The legislature must be kept clean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're willing to put ourselves in your hands absolutely,&rdquo; said the
      important man. &ldquo;I hardly need say that we should prefer to have the
      proposition go on its merits, but you know there's a new element here
      which is looking for money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you rich men with big projects are going to raise the devil with us
      if you're not careful,&rdquo; said McCarthy. &ldquo;Your plans are so vast and
      important that you will let nothing stand in their way&mdash;not even the
      price of a thousand men. Now, when you begin to buy votes you'll have more
      and more of it to do, and by-and-by Albany will be a pest-hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We feel that as keenly as you do,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;But, you know, those
      new fellows who have lately come here&mdash;Joe and Ed and Sam and Jim and
      Jack, and a score like them&mdash;they've got a following, and every day
      it increases. Their plan is to hold up the car of progress and demand our
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put the matter in my hands, and I'll get your charter,&rdquo; said the
      gentleman. &ldquo;But you must agree not to interfere or spend a cent of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We put ourselves in your hands absolutely,&rdquo; said the important man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then; I want to name three of the charter members of your
      board and the conditions under which that body shall begin its work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can promise that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, talk it over with your associates, and let me have your answer in
      black and white as soon as possible,&rdquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer came next day and was all that we desired, and McCarthy began a
      piece of work which deserves to be lifted out of the limbo of forgotten
      things, for it was the first big battle with Satan at the State capital.
      He saw the leading men in both branches of the legislature. He showed them
      the plans of the great bridge, and explained its purpose and made its
      value clear. They agreed with him. There seemed to be nothing in our way.
      But suddenly there came a change: the air was charged with opposition, and
      we knew that Joe and Sam and Ed and Jim, and other birds of their feather,
      had been at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the gentleman; &ldquo;we're in no hurry. They'll get hungry,
      and come to see us one of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had not long to wait. One evening, within a week, who should call at
      our room in the Delevan but Joe&mdash;the handsome, smiling, good-natured,
      witty captain of our enemies. He was in full dress, and his white hair and
      imperial were not the least of his assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thane of Glamis and Cawdor,&rdquo; said he, with a smile and a polite bow, &ldquo;you
      are soon to be king, and we must all know you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not suspected that you were a weird sister,&rdquo; said McCarthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am weird as the devil, but harmless,&rdquo; our caller laughed, as he took
      the chair that my friend offered. &ldquo;Could I see you alone for five
      minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, if you wish,&rdquo; said McCarthy. &ldquo;But first I want to talk with
      you about that bridge project of mine. I'd thought of you in connection
      with the board of management. Perhaps you'd like to be a charter member.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My mouth was open with astonishment. What could he be driving at? Was he
      compromising with the devil?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the board will have the letting of the contracts?&rdquo; our caller
      queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and many other important powers,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;They want
      substantial citizens who will work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I am at your service,&rdquo; Joe assured him, with another smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any one to suggest for this board?&rdquo; McCarthy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there's Jack&mdash;what's the matter with Jack?&rdquo; the other queried.
      &ldquo;Then there's a new senator just elected from New York&mdash;a hustler and
      a particular friend of mine, with a silver tongue in his head. He's a
      protÃ©gÃ© of Tweed&mdash;stands for important interests, and you'll have to
      reckon with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's his name?&rdquo; was the query of the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squares&mdash;Bonaparte Squares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not heard of his election, and could scarcely believe my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard of him,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;I believe he's a very popular
      and promising man, but I don't think he will do. We want men of standing
      and responsibility if we can get them. The board will be made up of the
      most substantial citizens, I tell you. It's no place for small fry. I'll
      consider Jack, and perhaps you can think of another man as available.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's Jim,&rdquo; Joe suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;I'll consider Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was about the end of the interview, and within twenty-four hours Joe,
      Jack, and Jim had received the pledge they required. The charter went
      through with scarcely a murmur of dissent. The appointments were duly made
      according to the plans of McCarthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a pity we had to have those fellows,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they won't like the job,&rdquo; said he, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were at the first meeting of the board. Every member was present. The
      president rapped for order and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, we have secured our charter, and now we have other important
      work to do. First, it is my duty to inform you that we have need of money
      and not a dollar in the treasury. I suggest that each member of this board
      lend the sum of ten thousand dollars to the enterprise, to provide a fund
      for preliminary expenses, and shall be glad to know your pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A motion was promptly made and carried, with only three dissenting votes,
      which called for that sum from each. The dissenting votes were those of
      Joe, Jack, and Jim. Joe rose, and protested with some feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if any member finds it a hardship,&rdquo; said the president, &ldquo;he is
      at liberty to resign, but I trust that all are able to meet the
      requirements. The money is likely to be returned within a year from date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks as if I were left at the pole,&rdquo; said Joe, as he sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the last we saw of the three outwitted sharpers in the meetings
      of the bridge board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe came to see the gentleman next day, and began his talk with high
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you want something for nothing?&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;Did you think I
      was naming you to pay for your influence? Why, I never bought a vote or a
      favor in my life, and never will. I told you plainly that we wanted
      substantial citizens only, and that it was no kettle for small fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled politely, and took off his hat. &ldquo;I salute you,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I thought I was something of a bluffer, but you've raised me out of the
      game. Good-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not long after that Jim attacked the gentleman with gross invective on the
      floor of the House. McCarthy took the floor in a silence full of friendly
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman alleges that I am a liar,&rdquo; said he, with calm dignity.
      &ldquo;Now, it may be that I have been deceiving myself and my friends, but of
      this I am sure, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has forgotten his manners, for
      I take it this is no place for the delivery of such information. He has
      said the like of one, also, who can never speak for himself again in this
      world, which is the more to be regretted. Without any disrespect to him, I
      may be permitted to doubt if he holds a brief for the judgment of the
      quick and the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His assailant never quite recovered from this rebuke, and ever after was
      playfully called &ldquo;the Judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McCarthy had ceased to speak of the gentleman within himself, but even his
      enemies did not fail to acknowledge and respect that great thing in him.

      HE next day, on the steps of the Capitol, I met the Hon. Bonaparte
      Squares, a large, portly, handsome man with a deep, musical voice and a
      brown mustache and goatee, He seized my hand and shook it warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I've been looking for you ever since we parted at
      Niagara Falls. I heard you were here, and I want to have a talk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went aside with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I want to pay you that fifty dollars with interest to
      date. I couldn't find you after the tight-rope performance or I should
      have paid you then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the principal, never mind the interest,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Here are seventy-five dollars. Please forgive me&mdash;the
      thing had slipped my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took only the fifty dollars, and asked how he had prospered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm getting along,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have a good law practice in New York
      and a house on Fifth Avenue. When you go to New York, if I'm there, please
      look me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left Bony, for the gentleman was climbing the steps and we had much to
      do.

      It was the middle of February, 1868. McCarthy was on some of the most
      important committees, including Ways and Means and Railroads, and had got
      his head above the crowd. Suddenly he was called to New York by the
      Commodore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to my house at 5.30 to-morrow,&rdquo; the telegram said.
    </p>
    <p>
      McCarthy wanted me to go with him, and I went. On the way down he told me
      that any day he was likely to be served with papers in a suit by the
      talented young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far they've done nothing but threaten,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It may be it's only
      a bluff&mdash;an effort to scare me. I wish they'd act if they're going
      to. Have you said anything to Sarah about this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; was my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;Above all, don't let her know that I love
      her. If she gets a suitable offer she ought to accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reason to believe that she is fond of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips trembled when he turned to me and said: &ldquo;Heron, if I knew that, I
      should be the happiest of men. But, you know, these are her best days. She
      ought not to wait for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We rode part of the way over steel rails at fifty miles an hour in a new
      &ldquo;parlor-car,&rdquo; which the road was trying, with a small buffet at the front,
      and where we could be served with fruit and sandwiches and tea and coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived at the Commodore's ten minutes ahead of time. The first Caesar
      of the corporations came into the small reception-room to greet us, his
      straight, columnar form neatly fitted with a frock suit of black
      broadcloth. His dignified face, his white hair and choker gave him the
      look of an archbishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy, I want to talk with you for five minutes,&rdquo; he said to McCarthy.
      &ldquo;Come up to my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were gone about half an hour, and on their return a clock on the
      mantel was striking six.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, boys,&rdquo; said the Commodore, &ldquo;it's six o'clock; you must come in
      to supper with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're not dressed for company,&rdquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Vanderbilt. &ldquo;You know where the bath-room is&mdash;go
      right up an' wash if ye want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In two or three minutes we entered the parlors, and were introduced to a
      number of people; among whom was the Rev. Doctor Deems. It was a plainly
      furnished house, as things go now, but comfortable and homelike. The
      pictures were mostly family portraits, the largest of which was one of the
      Commodore's mother. There were models, in gold and silver, of steamships
      and locomotives on the mantel in the great front parlor. We took our seats
      at the supper-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his best the Commodore was a playful and kindly man. There had been
      days when he wore his &ldquo;railroad look,&rdquo; and his words were as thunder and
      lightning, but now he was like a schoolboy. He ate only Spanish mackerel
      and a small venison steak, and drank a glass of champagne with it, and
      meanwhile said many droll things which have quite escaped my memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a man with a war on his hands, you're very cheerful,&rdquo; said Doctor
      Deems.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, I never let business interfere with pleasure,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I've
      reversed the old rule; my home is for comfort and pleasure, and I keep
      business out of it except when McCarthy comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Supper over, the ladies retired, and cigars were passed to the men, who
      remained for a smoke with the Commodore. He smoked big cigars, and always
      said that when he gave up smoking it would be time to give him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ship is that supposed to be?&rdquo; the minister asked, looking at the
      golden model of a ship trimmed with flowers in the centre of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Caroline</i>,&rdquo; said the Commodore. &ldquo;She was my first ship, and a
      beauty&mdash;brass and mahogany trim, and every comfort&mdash;and when she
      was all ready I gave Delmonico an order for the best dinner he could get
      up. He served it in her cabin, down the bay, one beautiful afternoon. I
      had landed at Staten Island, and sent for my dear old mother, and showed
      her all over the ship. Then I h'isted the flags, and took her into the
      cabin and sat her down at the table opposite me. There were a number of my
      friends seated with us. Mother was astonished. She looked around, and
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Corneel, how the devil did you do it?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vanderbilt,&rdquo; said Doctor Deems, &ldquo;I'm sorry, but I have to doubt your
      veracity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; the Commodore demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;when you sit there and tell me that your dear
      old Christian mother asked a question like that, it casts a doubt on the
      whole story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Commodore lowered his cigar, and said, with a sad smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, Doctor, she said it different&mdash;no doubt o' that. I
      have a miserable habit of swearing. Got it years ago, when my office was
      the top of a barrel down at the Battery. It seemed to be necessary those
      days, and sometimes I thought it was a help in the steamboat business, but
      of course it wasn't. I ought to be ashamed of it, and I am. I'm like a
      horse with a hitch in his gait: it's bad, but you can't blame the horse so
      much, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a touch of greatness in his answer, it seemed to me, and gave us
      all a broader charity for the lion-mouthed men of that day, and God knows
      there were many of them. A young man who sat with us asked the Commodore
      if he might quote his answer to Doctor Deems.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sonny, I haven't the least objection,&rdquo; said the Commodore.
      &ldquo;Everybody knows that I swear, and they ought to know why, if they don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was always very frank in the matter of his faults and vices, and his
      word for the meanest thing in the world was &ldquo;sneak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind telling us the secret of your success?&rdquo; the young man
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no secret in success, boy,&rdquo; said the Commodore. &ldquo;There's always a
      secret in failure, but not in success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On our way to the St. Nicholas, McCarthy said to me: &ldquo;To-morrow we're
      likely to see one of the greatest battles in history. It's between the
      Commodore on one side, and Fisk and his associates on the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what's the prize?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Erie road,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;It's in the hands of wreckers and
      pirates who are cutting rates, and are likely to make us all kinds of
      trouble. The Commodore is buying the stock; it will probably be cornered
      to-morrow. I'm pretty well loaded, and am going to sell everything but my
      Hudson River and Harlem stock at the opening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what he wants of more trouble, with all his riches,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He
      owns the Harlem, the Hudson River, the Central, the Lake Shore, and a part
      of the Michigan Southern. Isn't that enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he wants to build up a great, impregnable system,&rdquo; said McCarthy,
      &ldquo;the one we've been dreaming about. To be sure, he's got all the money he
      wants for himself and his posterity, but he keeps working and striving and
      building. Don't you remember that lecture of Mr. Emerson's, in which he
      spoke of man's love of the permanent? It was that love which slowly raised
      the Egyptian pyramids and the vast cathedrals of Europe. Now it is
      expressing itself in railroad systems, and tunnels through miles of
      mountain rock, and bridges over great rivers. We begin a long task, and
      know well that we shall never live to finish it; yet we strive and worry
      and suffer for it. Sometimes we give all for its sake, even our honor and
      our heart's blood. Like patriotism is our love for the permanent. We <i>must</i>
      work for those who follow us. It's God's will. Now you can understand why
      Vanderbilt is buying Erie: it's more rock for his pyramid. He's the great
      builder of his time. Drew and Gould and Fisk are destroyers; they're
      working for themselves. Vanderbilt is working for America; he ceased to
      work for himself long ago. He's Uncle Sam in flesh and blood, that's who
      he is&mdash;a plain, blunt, terrible fighting-man who leads the army of
      progress. No angel, but square. He could have robbed the Harlem
      bondholders, but he made them hang on till they got a profit. Next to
      Lincoln and Grant, he's the greatest man of his time.&rdquo;

      E walked down Broadway next morning, and turned into Wall Street some
      fifteen minutes before the market opened. Suddenly we heard a shouting and
      the scamper of many feet behind us. A handsome man with a young woman
      brilliantly gowned was approaching, followed by a crowd of newsboys. The
      man, who had a reddish-blond mustache and a white carnation in his
      buttonhole, was laughing as he flung handfuls of coin into the air, which
      fell upon the scurrying crowd. The face and carriage of the man were
      familiar, and I wondered where I had seen him before. We entered a hallway
      and watched them as they passed, but my eyes saw only the familiar figure
      of the handsome man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Maud Manning,&rdquo; said the gentleman, when they passed, &ldquo;and the man
      was Jim Fisk, 'the Prince of Erie.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim Fisk!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim Fisk,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Used to peddle drygoods up North. Now he's a
      millionaire broker, and the greatest rake and dandy of his time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it all came back to me&mdash;that summer day when I saw him drive
      into Waterville with four white horses and a big red van, and the
      wonderful lady at his side, and how, later, I sold my stock of goods to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that my danger is passed,&rdquo; said McCarthy; &ldquo;she has found bigger
      game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That historic day of February 19, 1868, had begun, and yet none of all
      those who crowded the Street and its offices before eleven o'clock knew
      what was going on, save two, and we had just seen one of them. Not even
      the Commodore, who sat calmly smoking in his office on Fourth Street, had
      any suspicion of the frightful snare that lay before him until midday. We
      found him there at two o'clock. He had invested some five million dollars
      in Erie stock that day, and held more, even, than was authorized by the
      charter of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Vanderbilt, it seems to me that this Erie stock comes very easy,&rdquo;
       said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commodore was wearing his railroad look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they're up to their old tricks,&rdquo; said he, with an oath. &ldquo;They're
      running a printingpress. They've been enjoined from issuing more stock,
      but they've no fear of God or the courts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think that they are printing new stock,&rdquo; said McCarthy, &ldquo;nor do
      I think that the Erie Company is technically disobeying the court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then?&rdquo; the Commodore demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when the injunction was served there was probably a large amount of
      stock all duly signed and sealed in the stock-books. I have reason to
      think that Fisk has stolen the books and put the stock on the market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Commodore ripped out an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll put 'em behind the bars&mdash;the suckers!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with some
      vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you'll stop buying,&rdquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buying! How can I stop buying?&rdquo; said Mr. Vanderbilt. &ldquo;I've got to take
      all the stock they offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away from us, and, as we were leaving, added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have information, put it in writing and let me have it to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the most deadly trap I ever heard of,&rdquo; said the gentleman, as we
      hurried away. &ldquo;He's got to keep buying the stock as fast as they offer,
      it. If he doesn't, it will go to nothing and ruin about every one in the
      Street, including himself, for probably he's borrowed millions on the
      stock as collateral. And the lower it goes the richer Fisk and his party
      will become, for they have sold it short; and if the Commodore holds it
      even they will grow still richer, for they have only to tear it out of the
      book and hand it over. They have got him between two fires, so that he has
      to provide them with the weapons for his own destruction. His own fortune
      is being hurled against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do they wish to ruin him?&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, their only hope of escape is in his ruin. Don't you see that if they
      bring him to his knees they have nothing to fear? Otherwise they may go to
      prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We walked in silence for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, it's a critical time,&rdquo; McCarthy went on. &ldquo;The future of our
      country is involved in this battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will decide whether the work of progress shall be committed to
      brigands or remain in the hands of honest men. Our best hopes are in
      danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and looked at me out of troubled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;suppose they cripple him and get control of the
      Vanderbilt roads! I shall sell everything I can and put the money at his
      disposal. Good-bye. I've got to hurry. Meet you at the St. Nicholas at
      seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he halted a cab and hurried away in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      McCarthy was only one of many honest men who rallied to the support of the
      Commodore that day. It seemed as if God himself took command of their
      hearts, and, indeed, I love to think so, foolish as I may be. The forces
      of decency and good faith hurried to the field of battle. The game old
      fighting-man stood bravely counting out his treasure until ten million
      dollars had been surrendered. Then the artillery of the courts began
      firing, and on March 12th the president of the Erie Railway and all his
      directors, including James Fisk, Jr., Jay Gould, and Daniel Drew, fled
      from New York by night, taking with them all the books, papers,
      securities, and funds of the company. They took refuge in a hotel in
      Jersey City.
    </p>
    <p>
      A well-known newspaper printed this paragraph next day:
    </p>
    <p>
      In the suite of the Prince of Erie, who fled from this city last night,
      was his friend, the well-known actress, Miss Maud Isabel Manning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at last I'm free,&rdquo; said McCarthy, as we read the item. &ldquo;How do you
      suppose I learned about the theft of the stock-books of the Erie Company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've no idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was through that somebody who has been sending me anonymous letters.
      For a day or two the books were in the rooms of Miss Manning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman left me to return to his work while I went to Philadelphia
      on a special mission. A week later I finished my task and returned to
      Albany, arriving there about eight o'clock in the evening. To my great
      surprise, I found McCarthy at our house. My sister was in her best gown,
      and never looked lovelier. She ran to meet me, and put her arms around my
      neck and gave me a hearty greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not move another step until you have congratulated me,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what&mdash;your looks? They were never better or happier,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm happier than I look,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;for I am to be the wife of
      the noblest gentleman in the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be McCarthy,&rdquo; I said, as I turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is and it isn't,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But I'm glad to confirm the report that
      she's consented to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you both,&rdquo; was my answer, and we were all so happy then
      that we just sat down and looked at one another and laughed until there
      were tears in our eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after all, mother,&rdquo; I said, presently, &ldquo;some good has come of that
      wretched journey of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All things work together for good if we will let them,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;there <i>is</i> a divinity that shapes our
      ends, rough hew them how we may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my mother; &ldquo;and that divinity is in our own hearts&mdash;there's
      the wonderful thing about it.&rdquo;

      ATE in March the astute captain of the outlawed army established
      headquarters in Albany, and sought the help of the legislature to save him
      and his comrades from the doom that threatened him. The dogs of the law
      were on his trail and in full cry. Only his intimates saw him, for he had
      rooms in the Delevan with a secret passage to the street. He came and went
      under cover of darkness and the protection of his friends. He had millions
      of dollars at his command. He wanted that illegal issue of stock, which
      had been forced upon Commodore Vanderbilt, to be investigated and indorsed
      and sanctified by the legislature itself. Any man that required buying was
      to be bought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was that the third house began its career of infamy, and the
      friendship of the gentleman and the Commodore came to its end. There were
      buying and rebuying on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a senator made a fierce attack upon the bill. In the midst of his
      speech a note was passed to him. He glanced at it, and continued his
      attack. Soon he veered about, saying: &ldquo;But, gentlemen, while this is one
      side of the subject, I am glad to say that there is another and a brighter
      one, to which in fairness I must invite your attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on with many and ingenious arguments in favor of the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the midst of this struggle that Bony came to me one day, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a frank talk with you. We have eaten and slept together, and you
      know me pretty well. I've always kept my word with you, haven't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've no complaint to make,&rdquo; was my answer. &ldquo;Now, I'm going to be frank
      with you,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;This Erie bill has got to go through. It's very
      important to me. If you can induce McCarthy to favor the bill, it will be
      worth a hundred thousand dollars to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bony! It's out of the question,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He's against it, and he's
      not for sale. You couldn't buy him with all the money in the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he'll do anything for you,&rdquo; said the tempter. &ldquo;He's a friend of
      yours, and they tell me he's stuck on your sister. All you've got to do is
      ask him and your fortune is made. Old Vanderbilt will drop him one of
      these days&mdash;there isn't a colder-blooded pirate in America. McCarthy
      would do better with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was dazed by the calm assurance of the man who stood before me. It
      recalled the day when he waved the crowd out of our way as we were
      approaching the tent of the rope-walker.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed as I looked at him, and rather enjoyed his anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're barking up the wrong tree,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There's nothing in it for you&mdash;not
      a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;McCarthy wants money&mdash;don't he?&mdash;the same
      as the rest of us. Of course he does. Well, he can make thousands out of
      us for every penny that he gets out of the other side. Thousands, old boy!
      I'll double his fortune in a day&mdash;in a day, do you understand?&rdquo; Again
      I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn't listen to you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;McCarthy is honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest fiddlesticks!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;So am I honest; so are you; but
      we're going to pick up money when it falls at our feet, aren't we&mdash;wads
      of it? Why, old boy, there's half a million dollars in this thing for you
      and me and McCarthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was almost on his knees at my feet, and I had just enough of the &ldquo;old
      boy&rdquo; in me to let him go on, and he persisted with singular blindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I've got something up my sleeve. You're in
      love with the best girl in this glorious land of ours. I know all about
      it, and, old boy, I hold the key to that situation&mdash;do you
      understand? It's in my hand absolutely. She's promised to marry me. You do
      as I tell you, and I'll make the greatest sacrifice that one man can make
      for another. Now you can judge how important it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm surprised to hear you make a proposition like that,&rdquo; I said, turning
      with disgust. &ldquo;It's base, and unworthy of human lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you've got a grudge against me&mdash;that's what's the matter with
      you,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;You can't forget that I won the girl in spite of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't play fair,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You have deceived her and her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;All things are fair in love and war, aren't they?
      Don't be a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bony, there isn't an honest hair in your head,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;He's a knave
      who isn't square with the girl he intends to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'll see McCarthy myself and leave you out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better keep away from him,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;or you'll get into trouble.
      We're against you and all men like you, and, as to the young lady, I warn
      you now that I shall do everything in my power to prevent the marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; he hissed, as I was leaving him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night McCarthy attended a committee meeting at the Capitol. I had
      some letters to write, and remained in our rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman returned about midnight, hatless and dishevelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I've just had a little argument&mdash;that's all. I was coming home
      by my usual route; the street was deserted; and by-and-by I came to a
      stretch where every light was out for some reason. I suppose the stage had
      been set for its drama. Suddenly a man approached me from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Is this Mr. McCarthy?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It is,' I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You don't know me, and it isn't necessary,' he whispered. 'I have a
      simple business proposition to make, and all you need to know about me is
      the amount of my roll: I'll give you a hundred and fifty thousand dollars
      now if you'll favor the Erie side in this fight.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman looked at me and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can imagine your answer,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you can't,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It was the most telling, off-hand effort of my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hit him over the head,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did; and down he went,&rdquo; said McCarthy. &ldquo;It was brutal, but there's
      nothing in the books to tell a gentleman how he should act when a man
      tries to buy his honor.&rdquo; He laughed again, and went on: &ldquo;I just followed
      my own impulse and let fly. Sorry I lost my temper, but it's done now.
      It's a bad situation we're in here. Huge sums of money are dangled before
      men, and the weak go down. The Commodore has to hold up his end, I
      suppose. He's got to beat them or they'll ruin him, and then he finds some
      excuse in the great cause he stands for. I don't blame him so much, but
      I'm going to keep out of it for a while. It's got to be a matter of
      matching fortunes, and I'm sick of it. By-and-by I'll step into the
      firing-line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the skirmishing ended, however, Drew deserted his camp, and the
      other captains of the enemy quickly came to terms, and the breach in the
      foundations of the house of Vanderbilt had been repaired. But the
      Commodore had had enough of Erie, and decided &ldquo;to let those miserable
      suckers alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The battle was ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      My friends, we may well regret the evils that came of it, but I, for one,
      rejoice that a commercial enterprise involving the growth and welfare of a
      continent remained in the hands of a builder and fell not to the kings and
      princes of destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some two weeks we saw nothing of Bony, and when I met him one day at
      the entrance of the Capitol I observed a red scar on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise, he stopped and greeted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's where a mule kicked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mule!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I didn't know he would kick,&rdquo; said Bony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All's fair in love and war,&rdquo; I quoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>I'm</i> not kicking,&rdquo; he said, with a smile, as we parted.

    <p>
      HAD seen Pearl often in hurried visits to Rushwater, but not since the
      Erie war began. For three years he had been hard at work in every
      department of the growing shop as superintendent. Its voices had turned
      from anger to affection; its people loved this man, for the years had
      proved him. He was like a father to them. I can think of scores of men and
      women who followed his counsel in those days of their youth and poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found him, soon after the events I have been describing, ill in his room
      at Rushwater. His eyes had been failing; one of his old wounds, which had
      cut deep into his head, was giving him sore trouble and affecting his
      sight. I was grieved to learn that he could scarcely see me. A young man
      from the shop was taking care of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been thinking of my gains, and they were large, for McCarthy had
      been kind and generous, and I was to have one of the highest offices in
      the gift of the State. But now, as I saw the failing of my old friend, I
      began to think of my losses, and was sorry&mdash;sorry that I had missed
      so much of the companionship and counsel of one of the greatest men I ever
      knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've missed you, Jake, I've missed you,&rdquo; he said, with trembling lips, as
      he held my hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have given it all then&mdash;all the money and the honor which had
      been mine&mdash;for that I had lost, and I have never changed my mind
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend and fellow-citizen,&rdquo; said he, cheerfully, after a moment, &ldquo;the
      Committee on Love and Marriage will now report. Has your heart changed,
      old boy? Do you still think of Jo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as ever,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Strange how it clings to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the real old-fashioned thing, an' rare as gold,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I know
      what 'tis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never marry,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will,&rdquo; said he, with confidence. &ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she loves you&mdash;that's why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you told me that she was going to be married on their return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she is; and to you, old boy. You didn't understand me, did ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I didn't want ye to. I see that Squares had made himself solid with
      the Colonel. Squares had prospered, and won the friendship of grand folks.
      Squares had flattered the old man and spent loads of money on him. The
      Colonel was bound to have Jo marry Squares. I told her to take her father
      out of the country and stay until I sent for her. He was drinking badly,
      and, anyhow, I thought it would do him good to get away from his old
      friends. Jo and he made a kind of treaty: he promised not to write to
      Bony, and she promised not to write to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Colonel wanted to travel, and Jo had plenty of money&mdash;her
      grandfather left her his fortune. They stayed a year in England, where
      Busby was born, and were three years in Italy, India, and Australia. She
      wrote me that she'd spent the time in study, and felt sure that you
      wouldn't be ashamed of her. Why, Jake, she's never forgotten ye fer a
      minute! She was anxious to know whether your love would last or not, and
      made me promise to report to her every month, and I did. They've heard all
      the news about you and all the news about Bony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On their way to Rushwater,&rdquo; said Pearl. &ldquo;They'll be here in this room at
      eight o'clock to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I met McCarthy in the office of the shop, and when our work was finished
      we went to Pearl's room. It was 7.30, and I paced up and down, feeling the
      slowness of the clock-hands, while the gentleman sat by the bedside
      talking with our friend. Suddenly there came a loud rap at the door.
      McCarthy opened it, and in stepped the Colonel, erect as a statue, with
      his goldheaded cane in one hand and his shiny silk hat in the other. He
      was magnificent in a frock suit and silken waistcoat. He bowed and stepped
      lightly to the middle of the floor, and stopped as he saw Pearl lying on
      the bed. He gave me his hat and cane, and put his arms around the
      shoulders of the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old friend, I love you&mdash;I love you!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel turned with streaming eyes, and in a moment said to us: &ldquo;My
      God, gentlemen, here is old Pearl Brown, the bravest man since Julius
      Caesar! There is not one of us that's good enough to black his boots. I
      saw him lead a charge at Bull Run when the bullets were trimming him and
      cutting his coat to rags; but he didn't mind. He went right on&mdash;the
      bloodiest thing that ever stood on foot. Went right over the works of the
      enemy, and hit a gunner on the head with his flag-staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we picked him up his clothes were red, and one arm was dangling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Boys,' he whispered, 'they shot my head off back there in the field
      somewhere. I saw it fall on the ground, an' I picked it up an' ran like
      the devil with it under my arm until I got here. It's right here beside
      me, an' I wish you'd bring it along&mdash;might need it some day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he lay sick in the hospital, Lincoln went to see him, and pinned a
      medal on his breast.&rdquo; The Colonel paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear old friend lay calmly holding the hand of Colonel Busby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not to blame for it,&rdquo; he said, presently. &ldquo;I didn't know what I was
      doin' after that piece o' shell hit me. I thought I saw my head on the
      ground, an' that I picked it up and ran as hard as I could, for I heard
      you fellows comin' an' thought you'd get it away. I forgot the enemy, an'
      was just runnin' to save my head. I struck that gunner because I thought
      he would take it away from me. Here is a braver man than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took my hand and drew me near him, and added: &ldquo;Look at the scars on his
      face; they're a better badge than I have. Took that blow to save me. Do
      you remember him, Colonel? You used to know him as Cricket Heron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said the Colonel; &ldquo;but I would not have known him, he's
      grown so big and tall. If he is your friend, he is mine. Excuse me, I'm
      going to get Jo; she's over at the inn. Perhaps you'll have the kindness
      to go and fetch her,&rdquo; he added, turning to McCarthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came in five minutes, the gentleman and Jo, and never have I seen the
      like of her. She was twenty-four past that day, and stood tall and erect,
      with glowing cheeks and eyes, in the full splendor of her young womanhood.
      I was ashamed to show my scarred face to her, and yet I would have
      travelled half my life to do it and know what she would say. She could not
      hide her joy, nor I mine. Our eyes filled as we greeted each other, and,
      somehow, I felt the truth in her little right hand&mdash;that she loved
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pearl made me blush with praise, and when I tried to disclaim the credit
      which he put upon me&mdash;knowing how small a thing it was&mdash;Jo
      commanded me to be silent, and said that I had no right to belittle her
      pride in a friend. The Colonel rose and stood erect, and stroked his white
      imperial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; he commanded, with that fine military manner of his. &ldquo;Heron,
      old boy,&rdquo; he went on, as he touched his forelock and swung his hand in the
      air, &ldquo;I salute you, and apologize for all the indignities of the past;
      and, dear friends, while we are giving out the medals of honor, I would
      respectfully invite your attention to this young lady. She is the greatest
      of all women&mdash;the dearest daughter in the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to me, and continued: &ldquo;You will remember, sir, my fondness for
      the flowing bowl and my many follies, which I would blush to mention. She&mdash;she,
      sir, with the tenderness of true womanhood, with the love that passeth all
      understanding, has lifted me up and made a man of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel was interrupted by applause, led by the gentleman, who rose
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman, I move that we give the young lady a vote of love and
      honor, and that we recommend her for promotion from daughter to wife, with
      the title of Mrs. and the rank of a great-hearted woman, as soon as we can
      find a man worthy of her. Greater than the man of the sword is the heroine
      of the home who has subdued its enemies with the strong hand of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I second the motion,&rdquo; said Pearl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Question,&rdquo; I urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel bowed low, and in look, word, and manner rose to greatness, it
      seemed to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those in favor will salute her with a kiss,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, as
      he embraced his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he led her to Pearl, who recorded his vote, after which he pinned one
      of his medals on her waist, and then the hand-made gentleman supported the
      motion. It was my turn next.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and turned away from me, her cheeks red as roses. Then she ran
      to the corner of the room, and hid her face in her handkerchief and cried
      a little, and I stole up and kissed her cheek and led her back to her
      chair, and every man of us had wet eyes for some reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Colonel, cheerfully, as he rose and went to the fireplace,
      &ldquo;with your kind indulgence, I will sing you a song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sang an old lyric entitled <i>The Man of Scars</i>, pointing at Pearl
      and me as he roared along, and, really, it took all the shame out of me
      which had come of my injured looks. I sat down by her, and we had a little
      talk of &ldquo;old times,&rdquo; as we called them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one spoke of Bony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the blood of the martyrs,&rdquo; said Colonel Busby, &ldquo;he hasn't a scar on
      his body, and never will have unless he meets with an accident!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which he has done,&rdquo; said the Pearl of great price, as he smiled at
      McCarthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we'd better go,&rdquo; said the gentleman. &ldquo;I'm afraid that our dear
      friend on the bed there is growing weary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We shook his hand and bade him good-night, and then McCarthy and I walked
      to the inn with Jo and the Colonel. They were to start for Merrifield at
      six o'clock in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should see our shop before you leave here,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take my father to see the shop, and I'll try to entertain Mr.
      McCarthy while you're gone,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel and I went together to the shop, then running night and day.
      We tramped through its long, busy floors, and by-and-by sat down, with our
      cigars, in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said the Colonel, presently, &ldquo;I should be proud to have you
      visit me at Merrifield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That cannot be,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;until I have your permission to propose to Jo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heron, I've been a fool,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hate to confess, but I can't help
      it, and then it doesn't matter much, for the fact is generally known.
      Forgive me, sir, and, believe me, I should be proud to have you for a
      son-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We returned to the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. McCarthy has been telling me about his stables,&rdquo; said Jo to her
      father. &ldquo;Perhaps he would be kind enough to show them to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to take you there,&rdquo; said the gentleman, as he went away with the
      Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he invite you to Merrifield?&rdquo; Jo asked. &ldquo;Yes, and more. He has
      consented&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merrifield is delightful,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;We live in the old house
      that was built by my grandfather. I've always said that if I ever had the
      luck to be engaged and married, I'd like it all to happen there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took her hand and said: &ldquo;Look here, young lady, I've made up my mind
      that I shall turn the key in that door and keep you a prisoner until
      you've promised to marry me. You've established a sort of precedent in
      your treatment of poor Sam&mdash;don't you remember it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Sam!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I couldn't have forgotten you if I had
      tried. He was forever talking about you, and to every letter he added a
      postscript, which contained the last news of C. H. He's watched your
      career very closely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat down by her side, and drew her close to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really cannot wait,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; she whispered; and then I felt her soul in her lips, and I need
      say no more of that day, best of these many of which I have tried to tell
      you, save this: Jo sad her father promised to delay their home-going to
      meet my mother and sister, who would be with us in the morning.

    <p>
      ROSE early and met my dear friends, and told them the news, and received
      their congratulations. Then I told of Pearl's illness, and at my mother's
      request took them with me to his room. We entered on tiptoes. He was
      stroking the ear of his old dog, who lay by his bedside. His &ldquo;jacket&rdquo; hung
      on a chair, turned wrong side out, within reach of his hand, the medals
      pinned to its lining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy New Year!&rdquo; he exclaimed, cheerfully, as he took my hand. &ldquo;I've got
      to tell ye the truth now. My name is Brown&mdash;Henry Machias Pearl
      Brown, full-jewelled and a yard wide. I confess and throw myself on your
      mercy. I've lied like the devil. Do you blame me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the man and not the name that's important,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a long story, but I'll make it short.&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;When I was a boy
      my father moved west&mdash;settled in northern New York. There I fell in
      love with a lily of a girl&mdash;oh, she was wonderful! I couldn't make up
      my mind that I was good enough for her. The minister used to tell us that
      we were all a lot o' worms, an' we believed it, but I thought she was the
      one great exception. I recollect that old text:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'<i>... The stars are not pure in His sight; how much less man, that is a
      worm.'</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I met an angel I naturally hesitated about offerin' her a worm. It
      didn't seem to me much of a compliment. Oh, I tell ye, we had to look out
      for the early birds! Ye see, the worm referred to was a caterpillar, and
      the minister didn't tell us about the butterfly. I tried every way to
      improve myself, but I waited too long. She married another an' a better
      man. I went away to the war, got my face all scrambled up by a piece o'
      shell, an' crawled into a lot o' bushes to die. I lay there an' kicked
      till my feet made a hole in the ground, but I didn't know what I was
      doin'. By-an'-by I felt suthin' pinchin' my hand. Seemed so 'twouldn't let
      me die; kep' a nippin' away till I raised my head. I could see a little
      out o' one eye, an' there was an' ol' settin' hen with her nest hid in the
      bushes, an' she was peckin' my hand. She gave me a cuff with her wings,
      an' told me t' git up an' go on 'bout my business, an' I did&mdash;crawled
      out on my hands an' knees, an' they found me an' patched me up. I felt all
      right, but I had this face on me. Come north, an' behaved 'bout as bad as
      I knew how. Got 'shamed o' my character as well as my face, so I dropped
      Brown, for that was the name o' my father, an' no better man ever lived.
      When I met you, Jake, I was nigh the end o' my rope. You made a man o' me.
      You was her boy&mdash;that's the reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice broke, and he pressed my hand to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother came and stood beside me with streaming eyes, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry Brown, I am Anne Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne Jones, come here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her wrinkled forehead and her white hair with his hand. He seemed
      to be vainly trying to see her face. He was like one looking far away.
      &ldquo;Oh, I can see you!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hair as yellow as a com-tassel, an' blue
      eyes an' cheeks as red as roses, an' feet like a fawn's. You are
      beautiful, an' I love you, Anne, I love you. I've wanted to tell you&mdash;these
      forty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be that she loved him, also, for she never left his side until one
      June day, more than a month later, we saw for the last time this modest,
      gentle, unknown hero of war and peace.

    <p>
      HERE was a double wedding at Merrifield in September, and, next to
      McCarthy and myself, the happiest man there was Sam, who shook my hand
      before the ceremony to give me courage, and spoke a cheering word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be glad you done it when it's all over,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      So glad have I ever been that I hold my peace when I think of that day and
      of her, the dearest blessing of my life. There are things which had better
      be let alone, even though one had the tongue of an angel. Such is that
      sense of pride and joy that came to me when I put my arms around her, and
      knew that she was mine at last. And, after all, the loves and marriages of
      the gentleman and myself are only small incidents of our history, which
      has to do with the loves and marriages of commerce, and there is yet a
      little to be added.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to Saratoga on our wedding journey. The day we arrived I met my
      old friend Swipes in the office of the Grand Union Hotel. He was cashier
      in the great gambling-house of John Morrissey. He told me that Bony had
      lost fifty thousand dollars in play the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It broke him,&rdquo; said Swipes. &ldquo;He had to borrow a hundred dollars from the
      old man.&rdquo; That very day I met Bony on the street. &ldquo;Look here, old chap,&rdquo;
       he said, as we stepped aside, &ldquo;I'm broke, and if you'll lend me ten
      thousand dollars I can do you a favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and looked into my eyes, but I made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that McCarthy has been looking for evidence against the Erie party
      for their sins in Albany,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;That's why he split with the
      Commodore. I can help him. I could tell him things that would put some of
      them behind the bars. The consolidation of the Central and Hudson River
      systems will be coming on this fall. I'll put a whip in your hands that
      will keep them out of Albany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I found McCarthy, and brought the two men together. The gentleman listened
      while Bony set forth his evidence and promised two affidavits in support
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said McCarthy, &ldquo;bring your witnesses to me. If they're
      satisfactory, I'll buy your note for one year for ten thousand dollars, on
      the understanding that we're both acting in the interest of public
      decency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jo and I left for New York a few days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a letter in my pocket to the Prince of Erie. It was from the Hon.
      Bonaparte Squares, and advised the Prince of certain facts in our
      possession, and gave him a word of warning. We thought that the letter
      should go straight to his hands, and I undertook to deliver it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll know who you are, and that will set him thinking,&rdquo; said McCarthy.
      &ldquo;You may talk, if necessary, but don't say a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned into Broad Street with the letter early in the afternoon of Black
      Friday&mdash;that memorable twenty-fourth day of September, 1869. Those
      two cunning men, Fisk and his partner, had a corner in gold. For an hour
      its price had been mounting by leaps and bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wall and Broad streets were like brimming rivers full of boiling rapids
      and roaring whirlpools and slow eddies and deep undercurrents. Now and
      then one heard a shrill cry like that of a man drowning. The currents
      swept me along, wavering from curb to curb. A friend touched my arm and
      shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake, old man! We haven't much to lose, and we're lucky. Every minute
      now somebody is going broke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took my letter to Fisk's office. By that time the price of gold had
      begun to tumble. Fisk's door was open, and I walked in. There, in the
      middle of a large room, stood the greatest gambler of an age of hazards.
      He wore a coat of blue velvet with a white flower in its lapel. He stood
      by a small table, and was pouring champagne into a row of glasses. A
      basket of wine lay at his feet. The chairs around the room seemed to be
      filled with dead men, their faces ghastly white, their eyes staring. A
      colored boy passed the wine. The Prince of Erie raised his glass, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, when you're picking a goose, the point is to get as many feathers
      as you can every grab, with as little squawking as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the letter I carried, and went with me into the outer office,
      reading as he walked. Men crowded about us, seeking a word with Fisk. He
      turned to me, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down a minute; I'm very busy now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took a chair, and watched the great gambler as he spoke to the men who
      pressed about him. He was jocular, good-natured, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, old fellow,&rdquo; he would say, with an affectionate tap on the
      shoulder, &ldquo;your turn will come one of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited for an hour or more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The market closed. The half-crazed players in this temple of fortune were
      moving out of its door. Soon the place was empty of all save the clerks
      and the Prince himself and two or three hangers-on.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Fisk was turning to me a man of clerical dress and manners accosted
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fisk,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we need a fence around the cemetery up there in
      Bennington, and I've come to ask you to help us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a finish for that deadly day of torment!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fence around a cemetery!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You don't need it. Those who
      are in can't get out, and those who are out don't want to get in, so
      what's the use; but here's fifty dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave him the money, and turned to me, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry I kept you so long. Come into my room a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I followed him, and he sat down beside me. He had carefully considered his
      plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had a hard battle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;War is war, whether you fight with
      guns or money. Here in Wall Street we cut close to the heart sometimes,
      but we don't kill, and we don't try to make ourselves believe that God is
      on either side&mdash;at least, nobody but Uncle Dan'l, and, you know, he
      builds a church whenever he grabs a million as a reward to Providence.
      We're like a lot of soldiers. We take what we can get, and when we're
      surrounded we cut our way out if we can. Do you like Albany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled as he put the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; was my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm going to keep away from there, and so are
      my friends. It's full of temptations. Think of that bargain counter!
      There's nothing like it in the world. I never saw such an array of
      jewelry, and all so cheap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We laughed, and I left him, and thought of the wise, far-seeing gentleman
      who had sent me there. I thought, too, of the long war of the Rebellion,
      and of all that its years of slaughter and pillage had cost us&mdash;a
      loss of respect for sacred things, which was, somehow, signalized in the
      character of Colonel Fisk, to whom business was war and property the prize
      of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had other things to do, and when I walked up Broad Street, in the early
      evening, the banks were all open and the Street crowded, and I saw numbers
      of men who had been rich that morning sitting dejectedly on the curb
      together eating sandwiches, and among them was Bony.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night I heard General Hampton say, in the lobby of the St. Nicholas,
      that there would have been no war if our railroads had run north and south
      instead of east and west, and it was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great awakening in the land. It was the age of invention.
      Hundreds of corporations, with millions behind them, joined the armies of
      steam-power and marched upon the capitals demanding favor. Enthusiasm ran
      high. Many a captain forgot other considerations in thinking of the
      greatness of his cause. They did much harm, but they were building the
      pyramids for us and our children forever, and we may say now, as we gather
      the fruit of their toil: Poor fellows! how little time was given them in
      which to regret or enjoy the things they did! After all, we can afford to
      repair the evil for the sake of the good.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thank God that I have lived to see the harnessing of the swift horses of
      Niagara, and the great earth laced with streams of power that turn night
      into day and day into immeasurable service.
